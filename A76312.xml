            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IT was not without ſome Reluctancy that I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd with myſelf to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my Thoughts upon the following Subject, to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic. I'm ſenſible a new Author is like a ſtrange Bird, ſtray'd from his Company; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently not only liable to be peck'd at by the whole Flight of Criticks, but expoſed to their moſt exquiſite Cruelties, rather than Wit or Judgment. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the firſt Adventures of this kind will receive Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:135106:3"/>from few, even among the Learned Order; ſince the ſofteſt, the graveſt Cenſures are, <hi>That the World is already too full of Books, that rather ſerve to diſtract our Thoughts, than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our Judgments, or improve our Knowledge: That the Preſs is the Parent of more Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences, or crude and empty No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions than uſeful Truths; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, ſerve to detain an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſed Reader upon the Surface, whilst a few, well-choſen Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, would let him into the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and Quinteſſence of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Theſe are indeed unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable Truths; and perhaps this Adventure may ſerve to confirm 'em. But this is not all; for it's obſervable ſome Men of Figure and Station, on every turn, diſcover their Averſions by
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:135106:3"/>their Wiſhes: <hi>They could heartily wiſh that the preſent Diſputes or Controverſies might fall, having no Proſpect of any good Effects or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages by 'em.</hi> I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs theſe are Admonitions that ſhould be attended to with Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to prevent any Man from being over-haſty in Commencing Author. But yet if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Induſtry, Inſolence, and Boldneſs of our Adverſaries, the open Attacks of ſome Authors, and the <hi>Artificial Inſinuations</hi> of Others; And in a word, the united Zeal of theſe Perſons to Unhinge and Demoliſh, without Propoſing the leaſt Model to ſucceed their Ruins; I can ſee no reaſon why thoſe that are Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates for Truth, and Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians of an Eſtabliſhed Church, ſhould ſuffer Controverſie to fall,
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:135106:4"/>by allowing them to empty their Gall and Filth without Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition or Controul. It's very certain, that the Notions, now ſo current and induſtriouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated, are the whole Stock or Cargo of Infidelity and Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion, of Error, Prejudice, or Diſguſt, that have been hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and nurſed in private for a whole Age together, and are now vented by the Liberty of the Preſs; and therefore thoſe that diſcountenance the Aſſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch pernicious Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſeem to eſtabliſh a new and unheard of Indulgence, which no one, but Criminals, muſt have the leaſt Benefit of. It's well known, the Conceits of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and Boldneſs of Irreligion are ſuch, That the moſt crude and frothy Performance, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:135106:4"/>to, muſt paſs for <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable.</hi> And this gives Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and Authority to the Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of an Adverſary in propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating his Notions; and by this means, the weakeſt and moſt uncouth Suggeſtions are by tract of Time rivetted in an injudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Reader, when an early Reply had cauſed 'em to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected with Scorn and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. From theſe Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Labours and Endeavours of the Members of our Church, may be ſufficiently vindicated; and, I hope, in ſome meaſure lay a Foundation for an Apology to my preſent Undertaking.</p>
            <p>I have here endeavoured to repreſent the <hi>Foundation</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures</hi> of <hi>Natural Religion:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Expedient not only to induce a Senſe of Religion, but
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:135106:5"/>to prepare the Mind for an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to Revealed Religion, the Complement and Perfection of it. I'm ſenſible there are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral eminent Hands have been engaged on the Subject; but having few of the prevailing Principles of this Age to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with, they have not fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len in with my main Deſign, which <hi>was to calculate a Scheme of Natural Religion in Oppoſition to 'em.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I thought myſelf obliged to Animadvert on ſome Authors, not only where they ſeem to overturn the fundamantal Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Morality, but where they have advanced Arguments or Inſinuations that carry a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt Tendency that way. This Deſign, I preſume, will eaſily obtain a favourable Conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:135106:5"/>ſince 'tis well known, That an artificial Inſinuation, or a pernicious Argument ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced by a Side-wind, carries a more fatal Influence than bold and peremptory Poſitions and Aſſertions. I muſt confeſs, the <hi>Author of the Eſſay of Humane <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> diſcovers ſuch a <hi>reſerved</hi> Way of Writing in all his Performances, that, I'm per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, he <hi>Deſigns</hi> more than he as yet thinks it ſeaſonable to <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs:</hi> And therefore I have uſed him with more Freedom, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige him to place ſome Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in a better Light, and expreſs his <hi>Meaning</hi> more fully, if not his <hi>Intentions.</hi> I have differed in my Opinion from two excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Diſcourſes;
<note n="*" place="margin">

                  </p>
               </note> but, I hope, my Reader will find nothing but a Difference in Opinion, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:135106:6"/>by a Thread of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Beſides, 'tis in Matters that do not affect the main De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of either of the Diſcourſes, that ſtand firm and unſhaken, eſtabliſhed upon the cleareſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and Concluſions. Thus much I thought myſelf obliged to Remark; becauſe I never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to Detract from the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter theſe Authors have juſtly merited, or leſſen the Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Eſteem of ſuch uſeful Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances.</p>
            <p>And now give me leave to conclude with a few Periods, with reference to myſelf and the following Diſcourſe: I have here delivered my Thoughts form'd in the midſt of a great many A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations. I have acted with all imaginable <hi>Sincerity</hi> in the purſuit of Truth, and reſigned
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:135106:6"/>up my Judgment to nothing but that Light, or thoſe Notices which were gained by the <hi>fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi> and moſt <hi>direct Methods</hi> of Information. I'm as yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded I have repreſented eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Lines of Truth; but if I have any where miſcarried, I can ſafely declare 'tis without <hi>Deſign,</hi> as much as without <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice</hi> againſt any I have oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. My great Aim was not only to recover diſcarded No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but a Senſe of Religion; by eſtabliſhing it upon its true Foundations; not only to ſilence Infidelity, but to remove that Scepticiſm, thoſe Doubts and Heſitations that prevail concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt important Points of Natural Religion. But theſe are Effects too great to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:135106:7"/>without the Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Heavenly Influences. We may Wiſh and Pray for 'em, but we muſt commit the Succeſs of 'em to the FATHER of Grace and Mercy. There muſt be ſome more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Effuſions of Grace to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage Men in the Uſe and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of thoſe Means, which God has eſtabliſhed for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcovery of the Divine Will; ſomething to take off the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of thoſe Ordinances which God has appointed for the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of this End; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that will Correct thoſe unjuſt, but prevailing Prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, againſt an <hi>Order of Men, eſtabliſhed by God in his Church;</hi> whereby they are rendred as deſpicable for want of Honeſty as Senſe. This is the Work
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:135106:7"/>of Heaven. God is able as well as faithful to accompliſh it in his own good time.</p>
            <p>If the following Papers fall into the Hands of Men of theſe Sentiments, I can aſſure them they'll find nothing of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginary Arts or Myſtery of <hi>Prieſtcraft,</hi> nothing of any <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning Leader,</hi> nothing peculiar to the <hi>wary Guardians of Creeds and Profitable Inventions,</hi> ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hinted by the late <hi>Author of the Reaſonableneſs of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi> But if any thing offers itſelf, that cannot well be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, I ſhall freely embrace a <hi>fair</hi> and <hi>pertinent</hi> Anſwer, and endeavour to make ſuch Returns as, I hope, may, at laſt, beget full Convicton on both ſides.</p>

            <head>THE INTRODUCTION, Concerning the Neceſſity of REVELATION.</head>
            <p>IT may perhaps ſeem a very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Entertainment to the Chriſtian World, to eſtabliſh a Line of Duty from the Records of the Book of Nature, when we enjoy a more <hi>ſure Word of Prophecy,</hi> or <hi>Form of ſound Doctrine, which is able to make us wiſe unto Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> or to delineate the Features of Moral Good and Evil, when <hi>Life and Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity are brought to light through the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel;</hi> or, in a word, to dwell on the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-principles of Religion,</hi> when we may <hi>go on unto Perfection.</hi> But certainly the Spirit and Temper peculiar to the Age we live in, is abundantly ſufficient to ſuggeſt an Apology: Are we not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly Attack'd as to the Truth and Authority of Revelation, and the Whole of Religion reſolved into a Set of Moral
<pb facs="tcp:135106:12"/>Rules and Maxims? And tho' others as yet cannot Diſcard all Revealed Truths, yet they act as if they were Advocates for the Cauſe; whilſt they allow no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Riſe, or Original to Moral Rules and Maxims, than <hi>Cuſtom, Education</hi> and a few unaccountable <hi>Traditions.</hi> Theſe (are Mens Proceedings which) ſeem to be embarked in the ſame Deſign, <hi>viz.</hi> The Subverſion of all Religion. Our holy Religion is by this means ſtript of its moſt convincing Arguments for its Truth and Divinity, its Intrinſic Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Purity; by an Appeal to the Precepts of Natural Religion. The Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever muſt grant, That if <hi>Cuſtom, Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> and an unaccountable <hi>Tradition</hi> give Birth to all the prevailing Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Morality, the Argument of the Intrinſic Purity of any Religious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts will fall to the ground: and when the <hi>Deist</hi> has beat him from this For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, he'll eaſily perſwade him that all the reſt is <hi>Cheat</hi> and <hi>Impoſture.</hi> The Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever having then thus far reſigned his Notions of Morality, will now come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Play, and do an equal Piece of Service to the <hi>Deist</hi> and himſelf too, by making both Converts to <hi>Atheiſm</hi> and <hi>Irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> For when the Morality and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:135106:12"/>of Mankind is wholly to be reſolved into <hi>Cuſtom, Education,</hi> and the <hi>Mode</hi> and <hi>Habits</hi> of Anceſtors, and Contradictions in Principles of Morality produced as a Confirmation of the Notion, what can more effectually ſubvert the eternal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions of Good and Evil, and as a Conſequent of it introduce and eſtabliſh a <hi>Law of Faſhion,</hi> as the only Meaſure, and Standard of Vertue? I will not po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively fix theſe Deſigns on all thoſe that have eſpouſed the Notion: It's ſufficient to my preſent Buſineſs that it carries a manifeſt Tendency towards the Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of 'em, or that it gives a Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the <hi>Impious</hi> and <hi>Prophane</hi> to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh their lewd Schems of Infidelity.</p>
            <p>It cannot therefore be unſeaſonable, to aſſert the <hi>Divine Authority,</hi> and <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal</hi> of Natural Religion; and that too not only by way of Vindication of ſuch an important Truth, but as it ſerves the Cauſe of Chriſtianity againſt the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of <hi>Deists</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers.</hi> Theſe are Concluſions ſo natural and obvious, that I'm perſwaded the natural Tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Doctrin, with an <hi>undiſturbed Toleration,</hi> will too fatally demonſtrate the Power and Efficacy of 'em.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:135106:13"/>
            <p>But yet, whilſt we endeavour to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate one growing Error, it ought to be conſider'd, whether ſuch Endeavours do not prepare the way for introducing, and confirming another more dang'rouſly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious: For if God has eſtabliſh'd a Law of Nature, antecedent to Revelation, as an indiſpenſable Rule of Duty, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to Mankind, and enabled 'em to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcover and embrace it as ſuch; the <hi>Deist</hi> will conclude there can be no Neceſſity for a <hi>Revealed Religion;</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolve it into a <hi>Contrivance</hi> of ſome <hi>Deſigning Men,</hi> an <hi>Artificial Syſtem</hi> of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Creed-makers,</hi> (as a late <hi>Author</hi> has Characteriz'd a certain Order of Men) to ſecure an Empire, as well as Maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from the ſilly Populace. I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs this is the great <hi>Goliah,</hi> the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion-argument which Infidelity has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to, to aſſail the Faith of the Living God, <hi>once delivered to the Saints.</hi> But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this is a lewd Attempt, for Men to think to Demonſtrate againſt a plain Matter of Fact, by putting their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries upon demonſtrating the Neceſſity of ſuch a Matter of Fact. This is to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance our own ſhallow Underſtandings above the Sphere of Infinite Wiſdom, and Reaſon, ſince we are reſolved not only
<pb facs="tcp:135106:13"/>to pronounce the moſt ſolemn Tranſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Providence uſeleſs, but reject the Truth and Certainty of 'em, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a biaſs'd Judgment is reſolved not to account for the Ends and Deſigns of 'em. But certainly, the Reaſons and Neceſſity of things are ſufficiently aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, by reſolving 'em into the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees and Proceedings of infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. If Revealed Religion is not <hi>from God,</hi> the Unbeliever has an eaſier Task to detect the Forgery. If the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever contends for a Divine Original, why ſhould it not be tryed upon its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Evidence? I mean as all matters of Fact are. But I am perſwaded the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of a certain Defeat, oblige the Infidel to decline this Challenge: For it's well known, the moſt avow'd E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to Revelation, even <hi>Julian</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, could never diſpute the Evidences of Chriſtian Truth; I mean the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of Miracles. However, ſince the modern Unbeliever ſeems to plume him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Succeſſes of this Argument, I ſhall for once allow the Objection, and venture the whole Merits of the Cauſe in demonſtrating the <hi>Expediency</hi> and <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity</hi> of <hi>Divine Revelation.</hi>
            </p>
            <div n="1" type="section">
               <pb facs="tcp:135106:14"/>
               <p>§. 1st. Now, in order to this, it will be requiſite to make a ſhort Survey of the <hi>Original State</hi> and <hi>Condition</hi> of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, both before and after the <hi>Fall;</hi> for by this means we may make a more exact Eſtimate of the Capacities, and Attainments of Mankind in matters of Knowledge, as well as Practice.</p>
               <p>It will readily be granted, That as God originally eſtabliſhed a Line of Duty in the very Frame of our Natures, ſo He undoubtedly created us with Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, to enable us to diſcern, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend every Part, or Branch of it. It's true, Laws of Nature were never preſented to the View of the Mind, by an Angelic ſort of Intuition, without Ideas paſſing thro' the Animal part: But yet Reaſon will oblige us to conclude, That the <hi>Glory</hi> of an <hi>Almighty Creator,</hi> and the <hi>Expreſs Image of his Perſon,</hi> came forth of his Hands pure and ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs: All his Powers, Faculties and Appetites, were correct and regular: Thoſe native Paſſions and Propenſions, which are now too often the Parents of Diſorder and Confuſion, were, no doubt, originally conſtant Attendants, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Handmaids to the Powers of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: That Love and Zeal, that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency
<pb facs="tcp:135106:14"/>and Delight, which are now fatally chain'd to ſenſual Enjoyments, were originally engaged and devoted to the Entertainments, and Exerciſes of a ſpiritual, rational Mind. Our chiefeſt Flights of Zeal and Love, were, no doubt, directed on the Improvement of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and the Diſquiſition of Truth. And certainly here's a ſolid Foundation for Truth: For here are not only native Paſſions and Propenſions, which ſerve as Springs to engage the Mind in the cloſeſt Reſearches after Truth; but the whole Frame of the animal Part, being thus correct, the Images of Things muſt needs be preſented to the View of the Mind in their native Shapes, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions, without the leaſt Paint or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe; and conſequently the Mind could act and diſplay herſelf in the largeſt Train of Deductions, without the leaſt Trippings, or Miſcarriages. So that Man, in his Original Frame, was ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to lay in a wonderful Stock of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Knowledge, and make a clear Diſcovery of the full Line of Duty.</p>
               <p>But beſides, it's highly conſonant to Reaſon to imagin, as the Great Creator of the World had adorned his <hi>Image</hi> and <hi>Repreſentative</hi> with all deſirable Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
<pb facs="tcp:135106:15"/>ſo he had not only entitled, but inveſted him with ſpecial Favours and Bleſſings, as well Spiritual, as Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral: For we muſt not ſuppoſe, that the placing him in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> only implies an actual Fruition of the whole Circle of Temporal Felicities; but the Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch Spiritual Bleſſings, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, as are ſuitable to Human Nature, whilſt it reſted on this ſide Heaven, and was not immediately inſtated in the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atific Viſion.</hi> Whilſt Man retained his primitive Innocence, he was no doubt a very choice Favourite in the Eyes of his Maker, and conſequently we muſt conclude that he enjoyed conſtant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications, and Intercourſes with him. For <hi>Paradiſe</hi> may juſtly be preſumed to be a kind of Terreſtrial State of Viſion; and therefore God no doubt diſcovered himſelf in frequent Adumbrations of his Divine Preſence, and vouchſafed ſeveral ſpecial Revelations, and his Divine Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours.</p>
               <p>Theſe may perhaps be thought unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Diſpenſations in a State of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted Innocence and Integrity. But, certainly, tho' Man in his original Frame was endued with a Sufficiency of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to Decypher the Line of Duty, as well
<pb facs="tcp:135106:15"/>as Propenſions, and Diſpoſitions to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and walk up to it; yet ſuch gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Communications were in ſome meaſure neceſſary, to maintain a deep Senſe of the Majeſty, and Authority of our Maker, and conſequently a deep Senſe of Duty, and Obedience; to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a deep Senſe of the Goodneſs and Purity of God, and conſequently poſſeſs the Mind with an inceſſant Deſire to act in Conformity to his moſt ſacred Will.</p>
               <p>Again, neceſſary they were to arm thoſe native Powers, and Propenſions with double Force and Activity; to u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and fix 'em on their proper Object, the Glory and Perfections of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, the Purſuit of Truth and Divine Knowledge; and conſequently to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage a Perſeverance in the Line of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, with the utmoſt Conſtancy and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution.</p>
               <p>Theſe were, nodoubt, the ſurprizing Felicities of <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> And they are ſuch, as almoſt placed him out of the poſſibility of a Miſcarriage, had he not, in ſome unguarded Minute, fell in with a ſubtle indefatigable Impoſtor. For without ſome ſuch Misfortune he could not have failed in retaining a perpetual
<pb facs="tcp:135106:16"/>Senſe of Duty and Obedience, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering in it, any more than in a diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the full Line of Duty.</p>

               <p>§. 2. But now Experience, as well as Reaſon, too fatally aſſure us, there's a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, and almoſt irreſiſtible Bias on the <hi>Animal Part,</hi> that bears an older Date than <hi>Cuſtom</hi> or <hi>Education</hi> can pretend to give; a Bias that diſcovers itſelf in the firſt Efforts of Infancy; a Bias that can never be perfectly regulated, or correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed even by the moſt exquiſite Arts of Education: When the Powers of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſeem to exiſt as it were <hi>in ſieri,</hi> folded up in Impotency and Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and conſequently (one would think) liable to be molded at Pleaſure; yet we find this Bias endu'd, as it were, with a Gygantick Strength, able to reſiſt the moſt powerful Antidotes, obſtinate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Commands, and untractable under Counſels or Perſuaſives. In a word, it has introduced an internal Rupture in the whole Frame of Man, renders him a kind of unnatural Production, acted by two oppoſite Principles, contending for two different Ends and Intereſts, and agreeable to the ſacred Language, it has raiſed an inteſtine and eternal War,
<pb facs="tcp:135106:16"/>for its a <hi>Law in our Members warring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Law of our Mind,</hi> Rom. 7.23. So that Man is certainly ſunk in his ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Frame, and lapſed into a State of Corruption and Degeneracy: This is Truth ſo clear, and unqueſtionable, that the moſt diſcerning Heathens have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Teſtimony to the Subſtance of it: They all found it wove in with their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and diſcovering itſelf, not only in inward Motions, and Propenſions, but mixing itſelf in their moſt exalted Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. It's true, they were perplexed in accounting for its Original, yet they all ſaw it in its Effects and Conſequences. Their Opinions were various; however, I ſhall mention the chief of 'em: <hi>Plutarch</hi> charges the <hi>Stoicks</hi> with aſcribing Evil as well as Good to God's Providence, and arraigns it as the height of Abſurdities. [See his Tract <hi>Adverſus Stoicos,</hi>]

<pb facs="tcp:135106:17"/>diſcerning Sages. However <hi>Gellius,</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuant to this, delivers it as the Opinion of <hi>Chryſippus:</hi> [This is the very Opinion which <hi>Plutarch</hi> ingeniouſly expoſes, <hi>Ib.</hi>] That Vice ſprang from Vertue, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>But further, not to dwell too long up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Authorities, it's well known, it was an ancient Doctrine among the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, to aſcribe the Origine of Evil, to certain malevolent Spirits, called <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> or <hi>Manes;</hi> that could exerciſe a Power over the Minds, as well as Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Men, and diſpoſe and incline them to evil Actions. <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in this very Treatiſe, gives a full Account of the Notion, and the Nature of 'em; nay, he delivers it as the Doctrine of <hi>Plato, Pythagoras, Zenocrates,</hi> and <hi>Chryſippus,</hi> following that of the <hi>Ancient Divines,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

The Opinion of <hi>Zenocrates</hi> is very remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, who attributes Obſceneneſs, Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and other Evils to certain powerful malevolent Spirits, inhabiting the Region of the Air, that take Delight in ſuch Things, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. It's well known, the <hi>Romans</hi> conſtantly aſcribed the Regimen of their Actions, to their proper <hi>Genius,</hi> aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two to every particular Perſon. Theſe did not only attend 'em from their Birth, and ſuggeſt Things to the Mind,
<pb facs="tcp:135106:18"/>but contributed to the forming their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Conſtitutions. Indeed, it's highly probable, theſe were Traditions tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted from the <hi>Greeks</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and from the <hi>Egyptians</hi> to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and all founded in the Hiſtory of the Fall of Man. And truly, <hi>Hierocles,</hi> agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to his other Divine Flights, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the Degeneracy of Mankind in ſuch a lively manner, as if he had taken it from the revealed <hi>Canon.</hi> In the firſt place, he deſcribes Man in his Original Compoſition, to be <hi>Pure</hi> and <hi>

                  </gap>. [<hi>Hier. Comment. in Pythag. Carm. p.</hi> 17. <hi>Ed.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; whereby an invincible Propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Things of this World is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted. He confirms the Notion by
<pb facs="tcp:135106:18"/>the Doctrine of <hi>Plato,</hi> and <hi>Empedocles:</hi> The whole Diſcourſe is excellent, from <hi>Page</hi> 252, to <hi>p.</hi> 272. The Subſtance of it is collected by the <hi>Learned Biſhop of Worceſter,</hi> and applied to the preſent Argument, with exquiſite Force and Accuracy; and therefore ſuperſedes the neceſſity of another Citation. [See <hi>Orig. Sac. Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 3.]</p>
               <p>From all this, it's indiſputably evident, the Learned Heathen World were high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſible of a State of Degeneracy; and tho' the greateſt part were in the Dark as to its Riſe or Original, yet ſome of the moſt Curious had preſerved ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Footſteps of it: However, they were all highly ſenſible of its diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Effects and Miſchiefs.</p>
               <p>But now Revealed Religion has a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly unfolded this Myſtery, by aſſuring us, that a Native Depravity was contracted thro' the <hi>Tranſgreſſion</hi> of of our <hi>First Parents.</hi> I know the <hi>Deist, Socinian,</hi> and the <hi>Author</hi> of <hi>the Reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of Chriſtianity,</hi> look upon this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to be a piece of <hi>Cant,</hi> or <hi>Jargon:</hi> formed <hi>by the Prieſts, thoſe wary Guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of their own Creeds, and profitable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions,</hi> as this <hi>Author</hi> has it. But as for the <hi>Deist,</hi> the general Senſe of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
<pb facs="tcp:135106:19"/>and the Doctrines of Philoſophers, are conſiderable Arguments to render the reveal'd Accounts of it highly proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: And therefore, unleſs he were able to diſprove the Truth, and Authority, of Revelation, on the ſame Foot that we overturn any other forged Hiſtory, I'm perſwaded unbiaſſed Reaſon will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his Notions, impudent Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, or Detractions. As for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's of the <hi>Reaſonableneſs of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> endeavouring to undermine the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Human Nature upon <hi>Adam</hi>'s Tranſgreſſion, (<hi>See</hi> p. 6.) he might have conſider'd, that it was always the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Doctrine of the Chriſtian Church. That it is made an Article of the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd Church of <hi>England;</hi> of which he would perſwade the World he's a ſound and Orthodox Member, and to which Article he has actually ſubmitted. And tho' <hi>the Word of God</hi> has no where in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Terms told us that this natural De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravity is the Seeds of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, yet there are ſufficient Authorities of Scripture, whence we may infer it, by a clear and convincing Conſequence. We can prove, that the Deſcendents of <hi>Adam</hi> were undoubtedly affected in the ſame manner with that of their Parent,
<pb facs="tcp:135106:19"/>and both by a <hi>Spiritual</hi> as well as a <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral</hi> Death; I mean ſuch a Death, at leaſt, as in the Language of <hi>Scripture</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a diſabling of the Faculties of the Mind, as well as a Diſſolution of the <hi>Animal</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> Principles. In a word, it may fairly be inferred, that, that carnal Principles, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that prevails in the whole Off-ſpring of <hi>Adam,</hi> whereby we are, as it were, <hi>ſold under Sin,</hi> or that reigning Law in our Members, that <hi>brings us into Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity to the Law of Sin, ſo that when we would do Good, Evil is preſent with us;</hi> is the Effect of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Tranſgreſſion. The <hi>Body of this Death</hi> was undoubtedly deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thorough his Loins, on all his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendents; and the Seeds and Principles of a higher Death were certainly tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, even tho' eternal Death were not formally imputed by making him the Repreſentative of Mankind, ſince theſe Seeds and Principles, in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Apoſtle, would at leaſt <hi>work in our Members to bring forth Fruit unto Death,</hi> Rom, 7. v. 5.</p>
               <p>I know the great Artifice, to which our Adverſaries have recourſe, to blaſt the Credit of this Doctrine, is, either to oppoſe it to the Juſtice of God, or Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue
<pb facs="tcp:135106:20"/>upon the Impoſſibilities of it: Becauſe God has not clearly revealed, and we cannot fully comprehend how ſuch a Depravity is contracted, much leſs propagated. But, certainly, it was never the Buſineſs, or Deſign of Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to communicate the Manner of the Divine Tranſactions, no more than to Authorize us to reject 'em, <hi>becauſe we cannot comprehend the manner of 'em.</hi> It was never a Rule of Revelation, to make our own Faculties of Perception, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending the Nature of Things, or in reconciling 'em to the ſcanty Notions we have conceived of another Revealed Truth, the Standard, Teſt or Meaſure of Faith. And therefore, to reject the cleareſt Evidence of Original Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe we cannot comprehend how 'tis contracted, or becauſe the Notions of Infinite Juſtice, tho' formed by our ſelves (as we think) muſt ſuffer by it, is Baſe, and Unwarrantable. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that our Adverſaries may want the Advantage of this Pretence, I mean, that Original Corruption can no way be accounted for, I ſhall attempt ſomething to demonſtrate how it may be <hi>Contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and <hi>Tranſmitted.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb facs="tcp:135106:20"/>
               <p>And firſt, This will eaſily be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, from the <hi>Nature of Original Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption:</hi> It's already concluded, That Original Corruption conſiſts in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitance of the Animal Part, or acts as a <hi>Law in our Members, warring against the Law of our Minds,</hi> contending for an oppoſite Intereſt to the Laws of right Reaſon, or the true Intereſts of Human Nature. Now, that this Irregularity may be the Effect of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, there are two or three Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that render it more highly proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:</p>
               <p>For firſt, Tho' the Violation of a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Law, contains but a ſimple Act of his Obedience, yet it certainly implies a horrid Violence committed upon all the Powers of Human Nature: When the Tempter diſplayed his Wiles, and form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his deluding Perſwaſives, it certainly threw the unwary Offender into the greateſt Agonies and Convulſions: It muſt raſe thoſe convincing Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Majeſty and Authority of God; it muſt ſuppreſs the Dread of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Puniſhments; it muſt break thro' all the Guards, and Powers of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and Fences of Duty; it muſt alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the whole Frame of the Soul, take
<pb facs="tcp:135106:21"/>off thoſe Deſires, and Propenſions, that engaged us in the Obſervance of God's Commands, and thoſe Satisfactions that reſult from the Obſervance of 'em. In a word, it muſt extinguiſh all the Powers of Divine Love, ſuppreſs thoſe Flights of Zeal in exerciſing the Mind, and Thoughts in Divine Contemplations, the Glories and Perfections of our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker; and in purſuing ſuch Things as will render us remarkably like him: So that this Grand Act of Diſobedience, muſt contain a Complication of impious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates and Reſolutions, before it was committed: For certainly the Powers of Nature being ſo exquiſitely fitted for an Obediential Temper, and the Soul ſo deeply poſſeſſed with a Senſe of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted Favours and Bounties of God, flowing from his frequent Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, and Communications; the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil muſt play his Temptations a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable time, before he could promiſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſucceſs. The Paſſions and Propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Human Nature, muſt not only be taken off from ſerving their great Creator, but turned a quite contrary way; they muſt be ſtrongly diſpoſed in grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the <hi>Lust of the Eye, the Lust of the Fleſh, and Pride of Life.</hi> And now,
<pb facs="tcp:135106:21"/>who cannot diſcern the Growth, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, of carnal Exorbitances, and conſequently the Eſtabliſhment of Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Corruption? It's concluded, that this ſingle Act of Diſobedience, was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on by a Complication of evil Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; inſomuch, that it ſeems to have the ſame Foundation, that in other Caſes ſerves to eſtabliſh a confirmed Habit; and conſequently, it muſt have the ſame Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy in fixing vicious Propenſions, that is attributed to vicious Habits. But now the Contagion of vicious Actions is too fatally confirmed by Experience and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, to be diſputed in Theory; every Act prepares the way for a Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition; but a confirmed Habit lays a Bias like a Second Nature; a Bias, that in the Sacred Language, is as uncapable of being remov'd, as the moſt ſubtile Productions of Nature: <hi>Can the Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian change his Skin, or the Leopard his Spots?</hi> It's manifeſt therefore, that the Diſobedience of our firſt Parent, intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced an <hi>Internal Corruption,</hi> by way of Natural Efficacy, not by way of <hi>Divine Puniſhment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But further, this cannot be well diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if we take in two other conſiderable Circumſtances that attended the <hi>Fall;</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:135106:22"/>which in reality were proper Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; I mean a total Excluſion from <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> and conſequently from the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Intercourſes of the Divine Preſence; and the Curſe that fell on the Products of Nature; we muſt conclude, that the Defection of our firſt Parents, introduced a perpetual, and almoſt invincible Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>
               <p>And firſt, If we all aſſert, what with good Reaſon has been already evinced, that thoſe ſenſible Adumbrations of the Divine Preſence, as well as frequent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſes with our Maker, were need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, to preſerve a Senſe of Duty, as well as Perſeverance in it; How fatally muſt the Excluſion from the Divine Preſence expoſe our firſt Parents to the Dominion of thoſe Luſts, which their Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence had newly engendred? But then, when they are not only <hi>driven from the Preſence of the Lord,</hi> but condemned to <hi>eat their Bread in the Sweat of their Brows,</hi> and converſe with little, but Thorns and Brambles, and the tedious Methods of Husbandry, how ſtrangely muſt their Mind and Thoughts be chain'd to Earth, and the inſolent Demands of the Animal Appetite? So that, when all theſe things are fairly laid together, I can attribute
<pb facs="tcp:135106:22"/>nothing leſs to the Diſobedience of our firſt Parents, than what the Word of God aſcribes to a State of Nature, to wit, the Luſtings <hi>of the Fleſh against the Spirit, and the Law of the Members war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring against the Law of the Mind, and bringing 'em into Captivity unto the Law of Sin and Death.</hi> If the Propagation of ſuch a fatal Contagion cannot well be accounted for in the Deſcendents of our firſt Parents, I'm abundantly convinced it muſt unavoidably eſtabliſh itſelf in the Frame of their Conſtitutions. But tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there's no Colour of Reaſon offers it ſelf, why ſuch a powerful Bias, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion, unleſs ſuſpended by an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling Power, ſhould not be tranſmitted by the common Laws of Generation.</p>
               <p>Indeed, when we conſider how much our Animal Appetites, and Propenſions that are engendred by Habit, depend on the Diſpoſition of the Blood, and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits, inſomuch that they often new Model the Natural Conſtitution; I cannot conceive, why a general Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of this Nature may not be propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as well as particular Features, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions, or Conſtitutions? I will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily grant, that ſome peculiar Turns in Nature, may alter the Frame of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb facs="tcp:135106:23"/>Conſtitutions, and diſpoſe a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſome peculiar Vices more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully than others; but I'm perſwaded, a change can never be effected by any, but one that has the Sovereign Diſpoſal of the Powers of Nature, <hi>that weigheth the Mountains in Scales, and the Hills in a Ballance,</hi> can prevent all vicious Propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions from being tranſmitted from the Parent, or their proper Off-ſpring.</p>
               <p>And thus, I hope, I have in ſome meaſure given a <hi>Rationale</hi> of an Original Corruption, that repreſents an <hi>unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble neceſſity of ſinning and provoking God in all our Actions.</hi> (See <hi>Reaſonableneſs of Chriſtianity,</hi> p. 5.) And yet it is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with the infinite Juſtice of God. I have enlarged more fully on the Subject, becauſe it will lay a Foundation to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the <hi>Expediency,</hi> or <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>

               <p>§ 3. And firſt, Having already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that Man, in his preſent State and Condition, is acted by two oppoſite Principles, involved in two oppoſite Intereſts, and each contending for Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and Dominion; it may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be diſcerned how our Attainments in Knowledge are affected; whereby
<pb facs="tcp:135106:23"/>Revelation will become highly neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</p>
               <p>Now, certainly, the Re-ſearches of Reaſon, in ſuch a divided State, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be elaborate, and correct: For firſt, it cannot be denied, but the Avenues of Reaſon, take their Riſe from the <hi>Animal</hi> Part; and conſequently, all the Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of Reaſon muſt make their paſſage this way. Nay, further, the <hi>Animal</hi> Appetites, and Paſſions, are the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Springs, and Movers of Reaſon; and therefore, ſince it is concluded that the Bias of the Animal Part is ſo formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably ſtrong and powerful, we cannot imagine, but Matters will be ſo ordered as to prevent any conſiderable Diſquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For by this means the Ideas of things will not only be often diſguiſed, and preſented in a ſalſe Light, or Dreſs, but the Importunities of the Carnal Part will not ſuffer the Mind to dwell upon any Object, that does not comport with its Intereſt; they will not ſuffer her to place it in the Scales, and try its Worth and Value, by any ſolid Debates and Counſels; and conſequently, Miſcarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges will ariſe, for want of due Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Attention of Mind.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:135106:24"/>
               <p>Now certainly, ſince this is the true State of Things, we muſt place the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of Knowledge under the greateſt Difficulties: It will not only embarraſs and perplex every Thought and Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Mind, but cut ſhort the Scheme of all our Enquiries; and therefore tho' the Fundamental Lines of Duty may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover themſelves to Human View, or Perception, we cannot think to launch forth into the Deep, and make a certain Diſcovery of thoſe conſequential Duties, that are abſolutely neceſſary to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Human Life. The common Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of Human Nature, will intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Knowledge of the principal Lineaments, and Proportions of Duty; but we can never deſcend to a Diſcovery of ſome other conſiderable Parts, and Circumſtances, that make up the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of Duty. In a word, frequent Retirements, and ſolemn Exercitations of Thinking may engage ſuch an appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Mind, as will enable her to work off the ſubſtantial Parts of the Line of Duty; but without theſe Arts and Methods, and without Time, and Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, a Man may ſpin out a thoughtleſs Life; or, at leaſt, the Mind will be weighed down by <hi>Animal</hi> Propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb facs="tcp:135106:24"/>and employ it ſelf in nothing but laying in <hi>Proviſion for the Fleſh, to fulfil the Luſts of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, now can any Man pronounce Revelation unneceſſary? What, tho' Providence has not yet left the World or rather the World reduced it ſelf to ſuch diſmal Circumſtances, but that with cloſe Reſearches, and unwearied Vigilance, they may calculate the main Lines of Duty; yet it cannot be deny'd, but we carry a kind of <hi>Ignis fatuus</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that will be apt to lead a great part of Mankind into Bogs, and a thouſand Miſcarriages; and therefore we cannot think it unneceſſary to be ſecured from ſuch fatal Hazards, and Difficulties by having a Digeſt of Laws laid before us, that remain as an unqueſtionable Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of Duty. What tho' the common Exigencies and Neceſſities of Nature, the Frame and Condition of our Beings, by the Light of natural Reaſon will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us to the Ground-work of Morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and natural Religion, it can be no Argument, that the Light of natural Reaſon can enable us to raiſe the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure; that is, either to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date thoſe Laws we can diſcover, to the Caſes and Inſtances of humane Life, ſo
<pb facs="tcp:135106:25"/>as to reduce 'em to Practice; at leaſt ſo as to anſwer the true Ends and Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Living; or to diſcover other Laws that are the Conſequences of prime Laws of Nature, and indiſpenſably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the Conduct of Humane Life, to the diſpoſing us for that State of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, for which God has originally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd us, much leſs to render our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices truly acceptable to God. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if we reflect on thoſe inextricable Clogs, Obſtructions and Encumbran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, wherewith corrupted Nature ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be encompaſſed; we muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it impoſſible, that the Powers of natural Reaſon ſhould carry us thus far: It's certain, tho' natural Reaſon may preſent moſt of the Fundamental Laws of Nature in a rough Draught; yet nothing but Revelation is able to give 'em their finiſhing Strokes, and their proper Graces and Perfections, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play 'em in their Conſequences Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages and Deductions; I mean ſuch as are abſolutely neceſſary to the Ends and Purpoſes of living well, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to a State of Happineſs: And therefore if natural Reaſon cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to furniſh us in theſe Caſes, ſhe muſt ſubſcribe to the Neceſſity of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:135106:25"/>
               <p>Indeed, I am perſwaded natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, by a conſtant Habit of Thinking, and a ſolemn Attention and Application of Mind, may make very lucky Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, very ample Diſcoveries, at leaſt upon probable Evidences, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions in very important Truths: But God knows, as the Frame of Man now ſtands, we muſt attribute ſuch mighty Performances to a <hi>Work</hi> of Time, to the Labours, and Obſervations of Ages; they can only be the Product of a few working Brains, that by a peculiar <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> have ſequeſtred themſelves from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Affairs, and conſecrated their Thoughts to the Obſervations of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature; and yet the Whole at laſt amounts no higher than a few gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Maxims, or Poſitions formed from a happy Conjunction of their own Thoughts, and the Obſervations of their Anceſtors; and theſe often claſh and interfere with thoſe of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and conſequently can carry no higher Authority or Character than <hi>Learned Conjectures:</hi> And now ſince Reaſon and Experience demonſtrate, as well as dictate the Truth of theſe things, a revealed <hi>Canon</hi> ſeems to be abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary for the Conduct of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
<pb facs="tcp:135106:26"/>or the Attainment of that Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which the Light of natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in a State of Innocency, would have otherwiſe ſecured. A Revealed <hi>Canon</hi> was neceſſary, to ſilence the immortal Diſputes of the Learned, as well as inform the Illiterate, at an eaſie Expence of Time and Thought. A Revealed <hi>Canon</hi> was neceſſary to give the moſt elaborate Diſcoveries of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the Authority of Laws, in as much as it was neceſſary they ſhould be uſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the World with the higheſt Credentials of Divinity, and eſtabliſhed upon competent and expreſs Rewards and Puniſhments.</p>
               <p>But to conclude this Argument, Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the utmoſt Attainments of Human Reaſon, I can ſee nothing to ſuperſede the Neceſſity of Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but what will as effectually ſet aſide the Neceſſity of Human Laws, and Civil Government. It's certain, That Laws of Nature, diſcoverable by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reaſon, anſwer the general Ends and Intentions of Civil Government, and deſcribe the great Lines of Right and Wrong, Juſtice and Equity; they aſſert the Rights of Property, as well as the Obligations of private Compacts:
<pb facs="tcp:135106:26"/>If therefore theſe general Notices be not ſufficient for the Conduct of Human Life, even in ſecular Affairs; we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine, that the Diſcoveries of Natural Reaſon ſhould reach the whole Line of Duty, with reſpect to God, Our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and Neighbour. In a word, ſince after the higheſt Pretences to a natural Light, it was neceſſary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute Civil Governments, and entruſt Men of Thought and Parts to work off a Body of Laws, for the Conduct of Mankind in temporary Concerns, by the niceſt Conſults, Debates, and Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations; how much more neceſſary is it to receive a Digeſt of Laws from an Infalible, and Unerring Hand to ſecure an Eternal, as well as Temporal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs?</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="section">
               <p>§. 4. Thus far we have advanc'd the Neceſſity of Revelation, in order to the Diſcovery of the Line of Duty; but there is ſomething more behind to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the Argument: For it's certain, we have hitherto repreſented the faireſt Part of the Landskip of Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; I mean as it lies in a degenerate State: It's certain, it is not only clog'd with thoſe native Encrumbrances, and
<pb facs="tcp:135106:27"/>Propenſions derived from the Loins of our Anceſtors, that weigh down the Activity of the Mind, but we are all unfortunately brought forth in Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; and conſequently are forced to ſuck in the Superſtition and Abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as well as Impieties of our Parents, of the preſent, as well as paſt Ages. Theſe muſt unavoidably grow up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with our Reaſon, and improve with the Strength and Vigour of our Bodies; ſo that when we arrive to the Uſe of Reaſon, we have not only na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive powerful Propenſions, but as vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Prejudices to grapple with.</p>
               <p>In the firſt Age of the World, where Men enjoyed the Inſtructions of our firſt Parent, the Laws of Good and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, Virtue and Vice, were clear and legible; the Stream was pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted, when it juſt iſſued forth from the Fountain; but by length of Tract, it gathered Filth and Mud; for every Age was a Common-ſhore, to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit all its Vices and Irregularities.</p>
               <p>This was the caſe of the old World, as it is of a great part of this, at this day; of miſerable <hi>Indians,</hi> as well as hardned <hi>Antediluvians; the Imaginations of whoſe Hearts by this means were to do evil conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:135106:27"/>and their <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings being paſt feeling, were incurably darkned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now certainly, when Men happen to be born under ſuch an unfortunate Climate, where inſtead of living, they ſeem to be buried in an invincible State of Ignorance; how is it poſſible they can ever be reduced to a Senſe of Duty, or act like Men, or Reaſoning Beings, till they are enlightned by the convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Beams of Revelation? Whilſt their Minds are encloſed in this State of <hi>Egyptian</hi> Darkneſs, no Wonder if in the Sacred Language they ſhould grope or <hi>ſeek after the Lord, if happily they might feel him ought, and find him, tho' he be not far from every one of us;</hi> and certainly, if the Caſe of ſome poor Wretches in the World was ſo deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, that they might eaſily miſs the Diſcovery of a Law-giver, it's impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they ſhould form a Body of Laws, as an indiſpenſable Rule of Action. Who can therefore diſpute the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of a Revealed Diſpenſation, when Mankind is reduced to ſuch forlorn and diſmal Circumſtances, any more than ſuppreſs and diſown the ſurprizing Graces, and Mercies of it?</p>
            </div>
            <div n="5" type="section">
               <pb facs="tcp:135106:28"/>
               <p>§. 5. Bur further, we may demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the Neceſſity of Revelation from certain <hi>Defects</hi> in Natural Religion, that are only to be ſupplyed by Revelation; and by this means we ſhall confirm and ſtrengthen the preceding Arguments. And firſt the Neceſſity of Revelation diſcovers it ſelf in the <hi>Notion</hi> and <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> of a GOD: It's well known, though the Conſideration of our own Frame, and of thoſe things without us, may by the Light of natural Reaſon induce the Belief of a God; and, at leaſt give us an imperfect Idea of his excellent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet certainly the latter is not to be attained but by Men of Thought and Obſervation. The unthinking Vulgar are ready to reſemble the <hi>Godhead by Gold or Silver, or Stone graven by Art, and Man's Device.</hi> But after the niceſt Diſcoveries, that natural Reaſon can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to, we can no where find the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head repreſented in its true Graces and Perfections, but in the Book of Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Again, tho' Natural Reaſon muſt dictate, that God is to be worſhipped; yet to calculate the preciſe Way, and Manner of it, ſeems to exceed the Sphere of its Activity: To worſhip God in a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Manner by Prayer and Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
<pb facs="tcp:135106:28"/>ſeems extremely reaſonable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe highly conſonant to his bleſſed Nature; but yet had Revelation been ſilent, Reaſon, that is ſo much immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Senſe, and ſenſible Objects, would never have carryed us much above the groſs, and ſcandalous Ways, and Rites of Heathen Worſhip. <hi>The whole World</hi> in theſe Caſes <hi>lay in Ignorance and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition;</hi> and therefore the Purity and Honour of God ſeems to induce a kind of Neceſſity, or Obligation on him, to make a Reform by a revealed Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation: It's his Prerogative to determine what Worſhip his Creatures ſhall pay him; and the actual Determination of it, is the Buſineſs of Revelation.</p>
               <p>Again, The Neceſſity of Revelation is abundantly expreſſed in the Enforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Divine Laws: For tho' natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reaſon might inform us, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Puniſhments are the inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Conſequents of the Obſervance, or Violation of Laws; yet it can never pretend to ſtate the Nature, or Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of 'em; and yet this ſeems abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to a due Enforcement of Laws, to ſecure an Obedience agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the general Intention of 'em. It's the Prerogative of every Law-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb facs="tcp:135106:29"/>to aſſign proper Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments; and if the Supreme Law-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of Mankind has not done it in a State of Nature, it's highly neceſſary he ſhould do it under a State of Revelation.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, I would fain know, whether natural Reaſon can make a compleat, and convincing Diſcovery of the Hiſtory of the <hi>Creation,</hi> or that of the <hi>Fall,</hi> and the diſmal Conſequences of it; of the Order <hi>of Spirits,</hi> and particularly of the Malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the <hi>wicked One</hi> and his <hi>Aſſociates;</hi> of the Nature of the <hi>Soul,</hi> and its <hi>Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;</hi> and of the Nature and Certainty of a <hi>Future State:</hi> Theſe are certainly Things of the higheſt Importance in the Affairs of Religion; and tho' natural Reaſon, and a nice Thread of Thought might advance a great many noble Speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; yet we find the Learned diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of ſome of 'em, as a kind of happy Preſages, rather than eſtabliſh'd Truths. <hi>Neſcio quomodo inhaeret in mentibus quaſi Saeculorum quoddam Augurium futurorum.</hi> [Sic. Tuſc. Quaeſt. Lib. 1. Tit. 4. p. 350.] And certainly nothing, beſides the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Communications of Heaven, could ſettle ſuch weighty Points of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy: Theſe alone were only able to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence the Eternal Diſputes, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions
<pb facs="tcp:135106:29"/>of the Heathen Schools. The World view'd 'em but <hi>thro' a Glaſs darkly;</hi> but Revelation preſents 'em <hi>Face to Face.</hi> The World in theſe Caſes was like the Men of <hi>Sodom,</hi> ſtruck with Blindneſs, and groping for the Door; the Key of Knowledge. They are the Beams of Chriſtianity, that are only power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enough at once to melt off the Scales, and convey a full Ray of Light into the Soul: It's a Peculiar of the Chriſtian In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, to diſplay the Nature, and Certainty of a future, <hi>and exceeding Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of Reward, and bring Life and Immortality to Light through the Goſpel.</hi> It's another Peculiar, to preſent Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind with a true Landskip of 'emſelves, and the Miſeries of their former Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; to diſplay the indefatigable At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks of the Prince of the Power of the Air, <hi>the Spirit that worketh powerfully in the Children of Diſobedience,</hi> and the true Methods of fencing againſt him: Are not theſe Diſcoveries of the higheſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance? Are they not indiſpenſably neceſſary to render us Favourites of Heaven, to ſecure Peace and Safety in this World, and to conduct us to the Regions of Happineſs in another? If theſe things are ſo, to diſpute the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
<pb facs="tcp:135106:30"/>of Revelation, is a greater Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Iniquity of our Will, than Judgments, ſince it is not want of Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or Conviction, but the weight of Baſeneſs and Ingratitude, that obliges us to reproach and quarrel with our Great Creator for his ineſtimable Mercies.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <p>§. But further, another Argument of the Neceſſity of Revelation will ariſe from the <hi>Miſchiefs,</hi> which the <hi>Fall</hi> has brought on Mankind, in reference to <hi>Practice.</hi> Indeed here an Original Corruption does ſufficiently ſignalize it ſelf; here it diſcovers its Strength and Authority in a very remarkable manner. For it's the general Complaint of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that the <hi>Animal</hi> Propenſions weigh down the Soul to that degree, that ſhe is not able to purſue thoſe Duties which ſhe plainly diſcovers to be ſuch. The moſt exalted Heathen Moraliſts, the moſt improved Aſceticks always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed their Impotence in Matters of Practice; they freely acknowledged that their Actions fell infinitely ſhort of their Informations, or the Line of Duty. The Orator has long ſince obſerv'd, That the wiſeſt Sages among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> as well as <hi>Latins,</hi> could diſcourſe and
<pb facs="tcp:135106:30"/>write upon Virtue after a magnificent Manner, tho' they ſhamefully miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, where it was to be reduced to Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice: <hi>Quibus cum facere non-poſſent, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui tamen &amp; ſcribere honeſte &amp; magnifice licebat.</hi> [Cic. Orat. pro. Coelio, p. 448. Ed. Lond.] <hi>So that it was not the Knavery of Prieſts, in filling the Heads of their People with falſe Notions of the Deity, and their Worſhip with fooliſh Rites; or in exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Reaſon from having any thing to do with Religion, that obſtructed the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of Virtue, as a late</hi> Author <hi>on every turn has ſuggeſted,</hi> [See Reaſonableneſs of Chriſtianity, p. 257, 264.] <hi>but the Corruptions of Human Nature, that ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the best Rules and Inſtructions almost uſeleſs.</hi> But now, ſince Mankind ſeems to be placed under moral Impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of acting purſuant to the Lines of Duty; it's abſolutely neceſſary ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions ſhould be made, as might put them into a Condition to bring their Actions in ſome Meaſure up to the Line of Duty.</p>
               <p>And, certainly, nothing leſs can ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſo great a Work than a written Code, and thoſe Methods Providence has contrived to enforce the Obſervance of it. By this means their Time and Thoughts will not be engroſſed in deep
<pb facs="tcp:135106:31"/>Reſearches after the Line of Duty; and conſequently a competent Share of both may be reſerved in advancing Arts and Methods to enforce the Practice of it. By this means the World enjoys a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Order of Men, by <hi>Divine Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> whoſe Office is not only to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Line of Duty entire and uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt; but to preſs and inculcate the Obſervance of it by all the Methods of Perſuaſion. By this means the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of ſpiritual Succours are aſcertain'd, to facilitate the Practice of Virtue; and certainly, where ſuch unmerited Acts of Grace are conferred, God may well be allowed to publiſh his own <hi>Canon,</hi> and require a ſuitable Obedience to it, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when the doing it is another Act of Grace, and unſpeakable Condeſcenſion.</p>

            <div n="7" type="section">
               <p>§. 7. But to proceed; the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Argument, to repreſent the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Revelation, derives from the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of <hi>a Mediator.</hi> It's abundantly concluded, That <hi>the whole World lieth in Wickedneſs;</hi> we certainly carry the Seeds and Principles of Sin about us, <hi>that will bring forth Fruit unto Death:</hi> or, <hi>A Law in our Members warring against the Law of our Minds,</hi> and <hi>bringing us into Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, unto the Law of Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb facs="tcp:135106:31"/>
               <p>This is not a piece of <hi>Spiritual Cant,</hi> invented by any <hi>Deſigning Leaders</hi> of an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nthinking Herd;</hi> we have traced it in it's Original; for <hi>by one Man Sin entred into the World, and Death by Sin.</hi> And tho' the Sin of this one Man may not be allowed to be the <hi>formal Sin</hi> of the whole World; yet the <hi>Seeds</hi> and <hi>Principles</hi> of Sin, engendred by this Sin of one Man, and propagated <hi>in</hi> him thro' the World, cannot be denied. In this Senſe, at leaſt, <hi>Death paſſed upon all, for that all have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> In this Senſe, <hi>all have ſinned,</hi> and come <hi>ſhort</hi> of <hi>the Glory of God.</hi> In this Senſe, the whole Race of Mankind <hi>were by Nature the Children of Wrath.</hi> The Vengeance of Sin did undoubtedly hang over our Heads, in a State of Nature; and conſequently Deliverance and Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty can only be expected in a State of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation. For, nothing but <hi>God, who is rich in Mercy, for the great Love where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he hath loved us, even when we were dead in our Sins, hath quickned us together with Christ; by this Grace we are Saved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Natural Reaſon will inform us, That the <hi>Wages of Sin is Death;</hi> for ſince eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sinner lies at the Foot of Infinite Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, the Methods of Redemption are lodged in the Hands of God, to be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
<pb facs="tcp:135106:32"/>as he ſhall think fit to reveal himſelf. If God intends a Redemption, infinitely more valuable than that Death which he might have exacted in every Man's Perſon, he may rightfully pitch upon his own Methods, and eſtabliſh his own Laws of Redemption. The Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Purity of his own bleſſed Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would induce him to contrive a Redemption ſuitable to the Nature of the Puniſhment, as well as Crime. He therefore reſolved upon a Subſtitute, or <hi>Mediator,</hi> and required Death for Death, Blood for Blood, even the Blood of the <hi>Immaculate Lamb of God,</hi> a Sacrifice not only negatively Pure, but of infinite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Worth and Value.</p>
               <p>It was therefore abſolutely neceſſary, God ſhould communicate himſelf by ſome ſpecial Revelations. The Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mankind was ſuch, that they muſt be eternally miſerable, without ſome ſpecial Communications, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſes with their Maker; and it was an Act of infinite Grace and Mercy, that God was pleaſed to make his Propoſals to his Off-ſpring. This, certainly, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduces a freſh Covenant between God and Man: God was obliged to ſignifie all his Propoſals of Grace and Mercy, or
<pb facs="tcp:135106:32"/>the Riches of his Love, and conſequently it was not only extreamly fit, but neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that he ſhould give us an entire Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Laws, eſtabliſhed on expreſs San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; and that theſe ſhould remain as inviolable Conditions on our part, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige him to make good all his Overtures and Diſpenſations. Thus the neceſſity of Revelation is eſtabliſhed upon a Train of Cauſes, and iſſues forth of the certain Frame and Poſture of Human Affairs and Exigencies. Tho' Natural Reaſon could inſtruct us in the Line of Duty, and we acted with Ingenuity and Abilities to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate our Lives conformable to it; yet, in as much as we have been Sinners, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than a new Covenant eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in a Mediator, can entitle us to the Favour of God, or that Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to which we were originally crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Let the <hi>Deist</hi> then ridicule the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Diſpenſations of his Maker, as long as he pleaſes, there's nothing, as yet, revealed, but what is wonderfully accommodated to the State and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Human Nature; nothing but what a Mind, that is not grown leud, and wanton with Luſt, will acknowledge to be the Effect of Neceſſity, as well as infinite Bounty; and he that diſputes it,
<pb facs="tcp:135106:33"/>I'm perſwaded, is embarked in the ſame Deſign with the <hi>Pſalmist</hi>'s Fool, <hi>That hath ſaid in his Heart, There is no God.</hi>

               <p>§. 8. I hope I have in ſome meaſure removed this mighty Objection; and, certainly, nothing remains, but a ſhort Return to the Abſurdity, which our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries would throw upon us: <hi>If Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> ſay they, <hi>were neceſſary, God must be obliged to have publiſhed it to the whole Race of Mankind.</hi> I'm perſwaded, there's no Neceſſity for Thought, or Art, to expoſe, or uncover the Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this Objection. It's abundantly concluded, That Man is the Harbinger to his own Miſery; and conſequently it's an Act of Grace in God to ſend Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Deliverance. If he is the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Lord of Grace, as well in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Time, as the Meaſure and Extent of it; there's no Injuſtice in confining it, either as to Time or Place: It's ſufficient that he has taken compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Methods for publiſhing his own Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſations, whereever he obliges Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to the Conditions of it.

               <head>CHAP. I. <hi>A Law of Nature antecedent to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AND firſt for the <hi>Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of a Law of Nature</hi> antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to Revelation, I ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the Voice of Scripture, as an Argument to thoſe that own the Truth and Divinity of it. <hi>For when the Gentiles, which have not the Law, do by Nature the Things contained in the Law, theſe having not the Law, are a Law unto
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:135106:35"/>themſelves; which ſhew the Work of the Law written in their Hearts, their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience alſo bearing Witneſs, and their Thoughts, the mean while, accuſing, or elſe excuſing one another,</hi> Rom. 2.15, 16. It's manifeſt when our Apoſtle tells us of a Gentile Law engraven on the Heart, here is a Law diſtinguiſhed from a Law of Revelation: For the <hi>Gentiles having not the Law,</hi> (no doubt the revealed Law of God, and particularly the Jewiſh Law) <hi>are a Law unto themſelves.</hi> It was not a Law that reſted on Patriarchal Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or a Law given by Inſpiration, but a Law engraven on the Heart, peculiar to Heathens, or Men in a pure State of Nature; and conſequently no revealed Law. For by virtue of it, they did <hi>by Nature</hi> (not Grace) <hi>the things contained in the Law;</hi> that is, upon the Evidence and Convictions of Natural Reaſon, not on the Authority of any external Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For <hi>whilst the Gentiles did by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the things contained in the Law, they ſhew the Work of the Law written in their Hearts;</hi> that is, they had a Rule of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, implanted in the very Frame and Conſtitution of their Natures, which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered to all the Deſigns and Intentions of a Law, or rather carried in it all the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:135106:35"/>Properties, as well as Force, and Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of a Law: For the Work and Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Law, is to preſcribe between Good and Evil, Juſt and Unjuſt; to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us in the preciſe Line of Duty, and enforce the Obſervance of it by ſuitable Rewards and Puniſhments; and if the Gentiles have this <hi>by Nature,</hi> they are in a ſtrict and proper Senſe <hi>a Law unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> even without the concurrence of Revelation. Indeed the Apoſtle elegant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſents the Force, and Authority, as well as Sanction of the Law, when he tells us, that Conſcience gives teſtimony to this Law, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and, as it were, confirms, and ratifies it as a Law, or Rule of Action, which anſwers to the firſt Office of Conſcience, by the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The Sanction follows from the ſecond Office of Conſcience, call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which conſiſts in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of our Actions to the Rule, and paſſing Sentence upon ourſelves for it; <hi>and their Thoughts mean while accuſing, or excuſing one another.</hi> From the words it's manifeſt there is a Law of Nature, or a Rule of Action given by God, by which he, at leaſt, originally deſign'd to govern Mankind antecedent to all poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Laws, whether Divine or Humane.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:135106:36"/>
               <p>Nay, it's not only a Law deſigned for Man in his original Frame, but a Law that maintains its Force and Authority, even in the lapſed State of Mankind. For it's manifeſt, the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the Gentiles as they then lay (and all the World too) in a depraved corrupted State. They were undoubtedly under a Law, tho' without any revealed Law, and that too, under the higheſt force and efficacy of it: For the Apoſtle expreſly determines the caſe, <hi>For as many</hi> (of the Gentile World) <hi>as have ſinned without Law, ſhall alſo periſh without Law.</hi> v. 12.</p>
               <p>However, thus far it is indiſputably evident, that the Heathen World was under a Law, or an Indiſpenſable Rule of Action, or Duty, and we are abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſur'd, that it was diſtinct from any revealed Law; ſince Scripture in other places expreſly fixes the Duties of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Religion, in an evidence that reſults from the Works of Providence, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of Natural Reaſon, not in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Traditions. Thus St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and his Aſſociate, ſpeaking of the Gentile State, <hi>Nevertheleſs he left not himſelf without Witneſs,</hi> (no doubt ſufficient to inſtruct them in their Duty) <hi>in that he did good, and gave us Rain from Heaven,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:135106:36"/>and fruitful Seaſons, filling our Hearts with Food and Gladneſs,</hi> Acts 14. v. 17. And again, <hi>The Wrath of Heaven is revealed against all ungodlineſs; becauſe that which may be known of God is manifest in them, for God hath ſhewed it unto them. For the inviſible things of him from the Creation of the World are clearly ſeen, being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the things that are made.</hi> Rom. 1.18, 19, 20. I know the learned Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> appropriates this latter Paſſage to the Gnoſticks, but againſt the whole current of Commentators: And indeed the Context, both before and after, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſuch peculiar Characters in it, as ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it abſurd to fix it upon any but the Heathen World. If ſo, it's evident they are <hi>the things that are made, and Rain and fruitful Seaſons,</hi> that are Witneſſes, and ſhew forth to us, <hi>that which may be known of God,</hi> or the lines of Natural Religion.</p>
               <p>So that the Works of Nature and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence are our Inſtructors, not the Voice of Revelation. Here's not the leaſt Hint of any Traditional Conveyances, the Works of Nature carry an Evidence in them; but they are the Reflections of Natural Reaſon upon them, that draw the Concluſion and form a Duty from them; ſo that whatever Difficulties, or
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:135106:37"/>Impoſſibilities ſome Men may ſuggeſt from the Imperfections, and Weakneſſes of Natural Reaſon in decyphering a Law of Nature, it's evident, the Sacred Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles have given it no other Foundation or Original. And this is Conviction ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ſilence all other Arguments in thoſe that ſubſcribe to the Truth and Divinity of them.</p>
               <p>And for thoſe that reject it, I ſhall, purſuant to the Mind of our Apoſtle, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to prove a Law of Nature, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in the Minds of Men, as Rational Beings, and conſequently, originally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd, as a perpetual Standard and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of their Actions.</p>
               <p>This I ſhall endeavour to perform, 1st, By proving, that Man is naturally a Thinking, Reaſoning Being. 2dly, That Man naturally Thinks and Reaſons in a fixt determinate way. 3dly, That by the exerciſe of Reaſon, and the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Nature, he can diſcern the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject-matter of the Laws of Nature. And 4thly, That he diſcovers it as the Subject-matter of a true and proper Law, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed on a competent Authority, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerning and receiving it as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God.</p>
               <div n="2" type="section">
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:135106:37"/>
                  <p>§. 2. And 1st, That Man is by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a Thinking, Reaſoning Being.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, that an Order of Rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, can of 'emſelves exert the Powers of Reaſon, ſeems to be a Propoſition, that carries its own Evidence in the Terms of it. And to imagine a Creation of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Powers and Faculties, and that too aſcribed to an infinitely wiſe Creator, and yet deny an inherent Power of exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 'emſelves, ſeems to reflect the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Folly and Diſgrace upon the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance. For it either repreſents Infinite Power and Wiſdom, diſplaying 'emſelves, as we ſay, in vain, or to no purpoſe, or labouring under the greateſt Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. It repreſents the great Exemplar of a Creative Power, to be little elſe than a ſenſleſs, unactive ſort of Machin, whoſe Efforts entirely depend on foreign Impulſes; and <hi>the expreſs Image and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative of a glorious Creator,</hi> in one ſenſe, to be of a baſer Alloy than the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking Brutes that periſh: Since theſe, in their original Frame, were made to exert thoſe Powers and Faculties God thought fit to impart to 'em. But Man muſt by no means act like himſelf, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplay any of his Natural Powers and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:135106:38"/>unleſs he has the good Fortune to be Born under the Influence of <hi>a skilful Tutor,</hi> and <hi>a poliſh'd Education.</hi> But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this is a Conjecture void of any ſhadow of Reaſon. For whoſoever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders the Activity of the Souls of Men, (a Truth I think of univerſal allowance and approbation) cannot imagine, that Men, even in this State, ſhou'd not be capable of perceiving, diſcerning, comparing, or thinking at all. But that we may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with greater Clearneſs in theſe Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, let us endeavour to ſtrip Mankind of all the Embeliſhments of Education, and turn 'em into the pure Garb of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and thereupon let us, for once, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Set of Men ſprung up like Muſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rooms in an inſtant, and placed in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peopled Iſland in their full growth and vigor. Some, perhaps, in this caſe, are ſo fond of attributing the whole Product of Humane Knowledge to the Buſineſs of Education, that they would deny them the Power of exerting one Faculty pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to a Rational Being without it. But certainly this is a Notion highly impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, if we conſider, that the great Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why our Infant State diſcovers ſuch faint Glimpſes of Thought or Reaſon, is not ſo much from any native Obſtructions
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:135106:38"/>in the Mind, or an Indiſpoſition of her Faculties, in receiving and forming Idea's, but from unknown Indiſpoſitions of the Animal Part. For the Souls of Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to act through Fleſh and Blood, or Material Vehicles, no wonder if they do not exert 'emſelves till theſe are throughly fix'd and ſetled, that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they arrive at a due ſtate of Matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or a ſuitable Diſpoſition or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament: And therefore were Men to enter upon the World under an exact Diſpoſition of the Animal Part, it's high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly probable the Faculties of the Rational Part wou'd exert 'emſelves with wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful vigour and expedition. Indeed it muſt be confeſs'd, that Idea's will be collected, and Principles ſetled at a much ſlower rate, where they are only gain'd by a Man's ſingle Obſervation and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, than where the Inſtructions of Parents and Tutors contribute to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement. By this Means the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations and Attainments of paſt Ages are preſented in an eſtabliſhed Method and Order, and added to our own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and conſequently the growth of Idea's will be more quick, clear, and laſting. But yet when the Organs of Senſe are rightly fixed and diſpoſed, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:135106:39"/>the Mind lies under no real Incumbran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or Eclipſes, it's ridiculous to imagin, that it cannot exert itſelf by its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Light and Activity, in all its Powers and Faculties: and we may as well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that a Man would not walk or perform any other indifferent Actions, as a ſenſitive Creature, without Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; as affirm, that he cou'd not think and exert all the Powers of Reaſon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpecial Inſpiration, Revelation, or Inſtruction. It's viſible there are certain Springs or Movements implanted in the Frame of Nature, that ſerve to put all Native Powers and Faculties into their proper Motions: And therefore we muſt conclude, that a Rational Soul, or a Soul framed for Reaſon, muſt act agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to its original Frame, and diſcover itſelf in all the Functions of Thought and Reaſon. It's certain, the great Law of Self-preſervation, a quick and pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Senſe of Pleaſure and Pain, and the inceſſant Deſires of Eaſe and Happineſs, which, ſtrictly ſpeaking, are rather Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Inſtincts implanted in all Senſitive Beings, than Laws peculiar to Free A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, will ſerve as forcible Springs to every Native Power or Faculty, and furniſh 'em with ſuitable Objects, as well
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:135106:39"/>as prompt 'em to exert upon 'em; and conſequently if Rational Faculties in their Original Frame are fitted for Thought and Reaſon, they will by an Intrinſick Impulſe exert in all the Parts and Offices of 'em. And therefore, to have recourſe to the Inſtance already given, we may juſtly conclude, that meer Salvages wou'd not only fall to Thinking, but after a few Interviews, form Signs, and Words, and Language, apply 'emſelves to the ſetling of all the Inſtruments of Reaſon and Knowledge. I'm perſwaded, few will deny, that Man by his Natural Powers cou'd form Words and Language, and Words neceſſarily ſuppoſe Idea's and Thoughts. To conclude this Argument then, As Man, by a Law of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, is peculiarly fitted with Organs for Speech and Language, ſo is he endued with Faculties of Reaſon; and ſince he's capable of exerting the one in all its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns and Functions, we may juſtly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him the ſame Abilities in exerting the other; and, in one word, it dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates from the Wiſdom of God, to endue a Creature with Noble Powers and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and not put him into a condition to exert 'em. Therefore we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that as Man, by a native Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:135106:40"/>can ſee, and hear, and ſpeak, he can likewiſe think and reaſon, which is the Firſt General propoſed in order to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh a Law of Nature.</p>

               <div n="3" type="section">
                  <p>§. 3. I proceed to the Second, which is to prove, That we think and reaſon in a fix'd and determinate way. And certainly this is a Truth ſo clear and evident, that it does not admit of any colour of diſpute: For otherwiſe I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive why we may not queſtion the Perception of the Senſes, as well as that of the Mind. The outward Senſes, in moſt Caſes, are a kind of Perſpectives to the Mind: and the Mind muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly receive its Notices from the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions which outward Objects make upon them; and if Objects make an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon the outward Senſes ſuitable to the Nature of 'em, they muſt do the ſame upon the Mind too. So that the firſt Act of the Mind, that of Percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, muſt neceſſarily be regular, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable; for 'tis a Faculty of receiving the Impreſſions of outward Objects, and of framing Idea's ſuitable to the nature of 'em; inſomuch that where the Object is rightly applied and attended to, the Idea is as certain and unalterable, as Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:135106:40"/>to the Eye, or Heat and Cold to the Touch. But now, as the Powers of Perception are certain and unalterable, ſo are the Powers of Reaſon; at leaſt in the original frame of 'em.</p>
                  <p>For Reaſon, being nothing but the comparing of two or more Idea's to gain a third, or form certain Concluſions and Deductions from 'em; as long as the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception is regular and correct, Reaſon muſt be ſo too; eſpecially where there's a due Application of the Object or Idea, and attention of Mind too. Indeed that the Reaſon of Mankind is fixt and certain, or acts in a true and regular Sphere, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from a Complication of Arguments.</p>
                  <p>As 1st, It cannot be imagined why Reaſon ſhou'd not be eſtabliſhed upon certain Rules and Meaſures, as well as all other Powers of the Creation; and it's a manifeſt Reproach caſt upon the Author of Nature to allow, that the Laws and Appetites of the Vegetative and Animal Part of the World ſhould be fix'd and regular, and that the Powers and Faculties of the Rational Part of the Creation a random kind of Ordinance, altogether precarious and uncertain. But then, whoſoever allows God to be the Author of our Beings, God to be the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:135106:41"/>Standard of Wiſdom and Reaſon, and the Reaſon of Mankind to be an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Tranſcript of it, muſt conclude, that Reaſon is eſtabliſhed upon fix'd Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and Principles. For God is unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable in all his Meaſures and Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; his Wiſdom and Reaſon is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and invariable, conſiſtent with it ſelf; and that Reaſon he has imparted to any of his Creatures, and conſequently the Reaſon of Mankind muſt correſpond with all this in a lower degree or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion. So that where all Impediments are removed, where Idea's or Objects are preſented to the View of the Mind, and the Mind cloſely attends to 'em, the Appearance of Things muſt be the ſame every-where; I mean in every Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Being. The Reaſon of one Man muſt be the Reaſon of every Man, and the Reaſon of Men muſt be the Reaſon of God and Angels too. This, perhaps, would be allowed to be an unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Truth, had Man retained the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Luſtre and Perfection of all his Intellectual Faculties; or were not falſe Idea's ſuggeſted, and true ones diſguiſed by the Corruptions and Exorbitances of the Animal Part. But certainly this does not deſtroy but perplex the Workings of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:135106:41"/>Reaſon; it diſcovers the Imperfections and Difficulties, not the Uncertainty of Reaſon; the Mind is by this means of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten call'd off, and deprived of that Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication and Attention, which is indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſably required in the Diſquiſition of Things, and particularly in the Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as well as Obſervance of all Laws. But when theſe are ſecured, I mean when there's a due Application and Attention maintain'd, Reaſon will be the ſame in a depraved and degenerate State, as it was in a State of Innocence. Indeed I'm perſwaded the true. Reaſon why Man under a degenerate State is ſo much affected in his Intellectuals, is the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Exorbitance of the Animal Appetites, whereby the Mind is called off from deliberating the true Nature of Things, and conſequently determins in conformity to 'em upon any plauſible Suggeſtions and Appearances; or if ſhe has conceived true Idea's, yet they are in a great meaſure ſuppreſs'd and ſtifled by the Impulſes of Luſt, and ſhe carried away by the powerful Overtures of a preſent Pleaſure. But I do not find, that the Mind in this State is abſolutely diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled from diſcerning the true Nature of Things or Actions. The Sallies of the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:135106:42"/>Animal Part are not always ſo powerful, but there are certain Minutes or Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals wherein ſhe may attend to, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate upon peculiar Objects; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently compare and form juſt Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, according to the Meaſures of right Reaſon: So that we may, without Dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to any State of Grace, affirm, That we are not under abſolute Impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilities in Decyphering the Line of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by ſtrict Reaſonings, though we may be deſtitute of Native Strength, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an Uniform or Steady Practice. Thus much the Chriſtian Inſtitutions warrant and confirm, when the Heathen World is concluded under Actual Sin, and <hi>as many as have ſinned without Law,</hi> are doomed <hi>to periſh without Law.</hi> For no one will be damned for Impoſſibilities. But after all, ſhould we allow, that the OEconomy of Reaſon, in this lapſed State, is very much ſhaken and diſſolved; ſo that all our Reaſonings are very precari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and uncertain; yet we cannot but conclude, that it was originally eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed upon fixed Rules and Principles; and conſequently, that we were formed by an Intrinſick Power and Efficacy, to exert every Faculty in ſuch a manner, as wou'd enable us to anſwer all thoſe Ends
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:135106:42"/>and Deſigns that God hath laid upon us as Men and Reaſonable Creatures. And this is ſufficient to expoſe the Aſſertion of our Adverſaries, that will have all our Notices enter the Soul, as it were, by Chance, that is, by Revealed <hi>Tradition, Education,</hi> or <hi>Inſtruction.</hi> It's manifeſt they do not reject our Attainments of this kind upon the Argument of Native De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravities, but upon the Argument of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Imperfections: In as much as the Soul, being <hi>Raſa Tabula,</hi> is equally prepared to receive contradictory Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions; and conſequently its Native Powers and Faculties imply nothing but a Capacity to receive the Informations or Inſtructions of others. Upon the whole then, ſince it's concluded, that the original OEconomy of Reaſon is even (in a lapſed State) only vailed and ſully'd, not wholly defac'd; we may ſtill affirm, that the Soul retains a Faculty of Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Reaſoning in an eſtabliſhed way: Inſomuch, that when Objects are fairly preſented to the Mind, and the Mind dwells and deliberates upon 'em, ſhe will ſtill be determin'd according to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Properties, and Agreement or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement of the things 'emſelves. And therefore we are thus far advanced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:135106:43"/>a Law of Nature, that we are acted by a Principle which ſerves to ſteer and direct us in the diſquiſition of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject-matter of a Law or Rule of Action, and that too ſuch a Rule as ſerves as a Law, not only to particular Perſons, but to the whole Species. For ſince it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that Man is acted by a Principle that naturally Thinks, Perceives, and Reaſons, and this Thought, Reaſon, and Perception is founded upon uniform Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and Principles, it muſt preſcribe in common to the whole Species, as well as particular Perſons.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="4" type="section">
                  <p>§. 4. The next Inquiry is the Subject-matter of the Law of Nature, how this ariſes, and is diſcover'd to us ſo as to form a Law upon it: And 1st, To ſtate the Matter with greater clearneſs, give me leave to have recourſe to the Inſtance already aſſign'd, that of Savages, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the World without the Bias of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation</hi> or <hi>Inſtruction</hi> upon 'em. It's al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready concluded, that Men, even in this pure State of Nature, are Thinking, Reaſoning Beings; and it may reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be imagin'd, that the great Law of Self-preſervation, or an inceſſant Deſire of Eaſe and Happineſs, will be the Spring and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:135106:43"/>Movement to their firſt Thoughts and Reaſonings. This, as has been already obſerved, is rather a Natural Inſtinct, implanted in all Senſitive Beings, than a Law given to free Agents. For every Individual, that is capable of Pleaſure or Pain, is violently diſpoſed to ſecure his own Preſervation; and therefore thoſe Beings that are endowed with Rational Powers and Faculties, and can Think, Deliberate, and Examin the Nature of Things, will certainly turn the Mind upon 'emſelves, and engage their firſt Thoughts in ſurveying the Nature and Condition of their Beings. For without ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this kind, it's impoſſible they ſhou'd apply themſelves to the true me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Self-preſervation. And hence, no doubt, ariſes the Subject-matter of the Law of Nature. For certainly all thoſe Laws, which have juſtly obtain'd the Name or Character of Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are formed from the Conſideration of Ourſelves, or which is the ſame thing, from the Conſideration of the Nature and Circumſtances of our Beings, compared with thoſe things that are without us. That this is not a groundleſs Conjecture, the Rule of Social Virtues eſtabliſhed by our Bleſſed Saviour, and advanced by the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:135106:44"/>beſt Moraliſts, ſufficiently atteſts: <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever you wou'd that Men ſhou'd do unto you, do you that alſo unto them.</hi> Here's a manifeſt Appeal to ourſelves; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently implies a ſtrict ſurvey of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the relation we ſtand in to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Beings, as well as of our own Wants and Neceſſities. And certainly, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever turns his Mind and Thoughts upon himſelf, and conſiders his own Frame and Original, his Dependences and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Subſiſtence, will preſently fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh himſelf with Matter enough to make up the Laws of both Tables; thoſe we owe to God, and thoſe we owe to Men. A little Thought will inſtruct us, that we were formed by ſome firſt Cauſe, who muſt be infinite in all his Attributes and Perfections: And as little Thought and Obſervation, that this firſt Cauſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted certain Paſſions in our Natures; ſuch as Love and Hatred, Hope and Fear, and all the intermediate ones; ſuch as Admiration, Tenderneſs and Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as well as Anger, Averſion and Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and conſequently we muſt conclude, that the Author of Nature has adapted them to peculiar Objects, and appointed 'em to ſpecial Ends and Purpoſes. And from hence we have a clear view of thoſe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:135106:44"/>Duties we owe to God; ſuch as Love, Worſhip, Fear, Reverence, Truſt and Dependence: For the conſideration of a Creator, and our dependence on him as Creatures, will inſtruct us, that we are to devote the chiefeſt of thoſe Powers, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, or Paſſions he has implanted in us, to his Service and Honour. Again, for the Laws of the Second Table, the conſideration of the methods of our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence will inſtruct us, that we are in a great meaſure maintain'd by foreign Aids and Succours, that we ſubſiſt upon the Art and Bleſſings of Labour, as well as Nature; and theſe are to be carried on by Creatures that can Reaſon, Think, and Project as we do: And this will prompt us to Society, and ingage us to apply ourſelves to thoſe Creatures that moſt reſemble ourſelves, and are moſt capable of ſerving or adminiſtring out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Goods and Bleſſings to us. The neceſſary methods of Subſiſtence, and the condition of our Natures will preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtruct us in the Rights of Property; and conſequently give us a view of the Neceſſity of Promiſes, Compacts or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, and our indiſpenſable Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to maintain and execute 'em. And from all theſe Notices reſults the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:135106:45"/>Law of univerſal Juſtice. We cannot kill nor aſſault the Perſons of our Neighbours, becauſe it's a wounding or ſtabbing our ſelves; ſince it cuts off that Circulation of Bleſſings we live by. We cannot ſpoil or plunder the Goods of our Neighbour, becauſe that affects us in the ſame manner as that of Murther. To proceed, hence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the Laws of univerſal Love, Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Compaſſion: For we find theſe Paſſions implanted in the Frame of our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Natures; And where can we think to fix and exert them better, than on thoſe that contribute to our Subſiſtence? This naturally begets a Senſe of Benefits, and thoſe of Love and Compaſſion. In a word, Self-preſervation ſuggeſts Self-love, and a Tenderneſs, and Kindneſs towards ourſelves; and conſequently it will exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the very ſame Affections to the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of others. For ſince Love, Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Compaſſion, are the moſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Ingagements to link others to our Intereſt, and our Intereſt and Welfare reſts upon the Welfare of others; to be kind, compaſſionate and loving to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, is to be ſo to ourſelves. Theſe are Laws recorded in ſuch legible Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, that the Subject-matter of 'em has diſcovered itſelf to meer Savages, that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:135106:45"/>ſprung up like Muſhrooms, tho' there were no ſuch Relation as Husband and Wife, Parent or Children, or in a word, were no way allied or dependent but by the common Condition and Principles of Humanity. Here needs no long Train of Thoughts, Conſequences and Deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whereby the Mind under the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Improvements is often bewildred, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſet and confounded. The common Neceſſities of our Natures and the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Beings, forcibly direct us to the diſcovery; a ſingle Inference will give us a full view: So that were the Mind left to her own native Exercitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, before ſhe had contracted a Bias from Example, or a vicious Education, they muſt unavoidably appear in ſome of her firſt and earlieſt Reaſonings. Indeed I will not affirm, that every one in this caſe cou'd diſcover the Subject-matter of the prime Laws of Nature, in that Train of Thought, or from thoſe very Topicks and Arguments that are here projected. It's ſufficient if they are natural and obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and carry an Evidence ſuitable to what they are apply'd and are deſign'd to prove. There may a thouſand Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments ſuggeſt the ſame thing, and therefore it is not material which way we
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:135106:46"/>come by it. That which is moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable is, that it appears the Subject-matter of the Laws of Nature, lies upon the Surface, and offers itſelf to the firſt Dawnings of Reaſon: It is as fixt and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain as the firſt workings of Reaſon (for both reſult from the eſtabliſhed Frame or Nature of Things) and is mixed with the prime Ends and Intereſts of our Beings; and we muſt firſt change the Courſe of Nature, and new model the Creator as well as the Creature, and give new Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, new Paſſions, and new Beings, before the Matter of the Laws of Nature can be changed. Thus we have advanc'd a conſiderable way in the Proof of a Law of Nature; ſince it appears we are acted by a uniforn Principle within, that is able to furniſh us with the Subject-mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Laws or Rules of Action.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>§.</hi> 5. But now, ſince the Subject-mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Laws is fixt and determined, the laſt Requiſite to give any thing the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a Law, is to eſtabliſh it upon a competent Authority, whereby the Counſels and Dictates of Reaſon are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced into indiſpenſable Rules of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It's certain Reaſon is the ſovereign Principle of the Man; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:135106:46"/>if ſhe pleaſes, may paſs an Obligation upon all her own Decrees, as far as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the particular Perſon, where ſhe preſides. But ſhe cannot paſs an Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon other Perſons, without ſome binding Authority, that preſides over her and them too; and conſequently cannot eſtabliſh a Law of Nature, which carries an Obligation, that extends to the whole Species; this ſuppoſes an Authority ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to that of particular Perſons. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, the natural Conveniences, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences of things may engage us to embrace and purſue particular Dictates of Reaſon; but theſe Dictates of Reaſon may not be a binding, and indiſpenſable Rule of Action; ſo as to render us crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in caſe we do not purſue, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace them; which is the Purport, and Buſineſs of all Laws. And therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe Dictates of Reaſon are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as true and proper Laws; we muſt prove, that they are impoſed by a competent Authority, an Authority that has a Right to impoſe a Rule of Action upon us; an Authority that has a Right to impoſe the Dictates of Reaſon as a Rule of Action, and that this Authority has actually impoſed 'em as Laws, and conſequently, the Non-obſervance of 'em
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:135106:47"/>muſt bring Guilt and Puniſhment upon us. Theſe are all Poſitions that muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the workings of Natural Reaſon, before any Dictates of Reaſon can paſs for Laws of Nature. Now this will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly appear by placing the Authority of Laws of Nature in the Author of Nature; for tho' that which we call Reaſon or Conſcience, is the Law-giver, that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately preſcribes, determines, and fixes the Obligation of our Actions; yet this is but a delegated Authority, derived from the Author of Nature, the very Author of Reaſon and Conſcience, and our very Beings too. So that Reaſon acts by the Authority of a Vicegerent, but the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sovereignty derives from God, or the Author of Nature. Natural Reaſon and Conſcience is but a Law-giver, like <hi>Moſes</hi> that delivered the Law to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but the original Authority is ſeated within the Cloud of Glory, and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature; whoſe Face no Mortal can behold, and live: That there is a God, and an Author of Nature, the conſideration of ourſelves will abundantly evince; and the Right of God's Authority in impoſing Laws, and particularly in aſſigning Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Conſcience a power of giving Laws, cannot be diſputed. For he that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:135106:47"/>gave us our Being, may rightfully aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign the Laws of our Being. Therefore we ſufficiently prove the Authority of Laws of Nature, if we can prove that God, as our Creator, has appointed cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Dictates of Reaſon for an indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Rule of Action to Mankind. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this is a Poſition almoſt Self-evident; for it follows from the bare Allowance and Conſideration of the Author of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. If Natural Reaſon aſſures us that God made us, and not we ourſelves, we muſt conclude, that we have the Strokes and Lineaments of Infinite Wiſdom ſet forth in us. For, the Works of Nature and Providence, are no leſs an effect of Infinite Wiſdom, than Power: <hi>For in Wiſdom hath he made them all.</hi> And if it was Infinite Wiſdom that induced a Creator to give us ſuch a peculiar Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, whereby we are diſtinguiſhed from the reſt of his Creatures, the ſame Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Wiſdom muſt intend we ſhould act and govern ourſelves by it. The Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law-giver is as much expreſs'd by reaſonable Creatures, acting upon Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of Reaſon, as by the Powers and Tendences of Inanimate Beings purſuing the Courſe and Order of Nature. He hath given Laws to the Waves of the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:135106:48"/>Sea, <hi>that they may not paſs; and to the Sun that knoweth his going down,</hi> Pſal. 104. v. 18, 19. And ſhall not Man, the Glory of his Maker, and the proper Subject of a free and valuable Obedience, be obliged by the Laws of his Creation; and make that the Rule of Action, which Infinite Wiſdom has made the Mark or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtick of his Being; whereby he is diſtinguiſhed from the inferiour Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Creation, as well as Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his Creator's Honour and Glory? In a word, ſince God perpetually acts by the Dictates of Infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs, his own Inſtitutions or Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances are an indiſputable Evidence of his moſt ſacred Will and Pleaſure; and the Laws of all his Creatures are as am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply recorded in that Frame and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution he has given 'em, (being all as much bound to act by 'em) as if he had recorded 'em on Tables of Stone. For 'tis a Record engraved on Nature, and conſequently will be preſerved as long as Nature has a Being. Theſe are Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that offer 'emſelves to the firſt Daw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of Reaſon, or, at leaſt, flow in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an Aſſent to this fundamental Truth, that we are the Product or Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of an All-wiſe and Almighty Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:135106:48"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>§.</hi> 6. But further, the Authority of Laws of Nature is evident from the Ends and Deſigns of Created Nature.</p>
                  <p>And 1st, As Natural Reaſon inſtructs us, That there is a wiſe and intelligent Author of Nature, even the Author of that very Faculty we call Reaſon, which ſuggeſts thus much to us; we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that he neither gave Being to that nor any thing elſe, without annexing ſome ſpecial Ends and Deſigns to it. If therefore, to purſue the Dictates of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Creatures, can only ſecure thoſe Ends for which we were created reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Creatures, the Dictates of Reaſon muſt carry the Authority and Obligation of Laws in 'em: But now ſhould we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce one ſpecial End of Man's Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be the Manifeſtation of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Glory, and particularly the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplification of his Wiſdom and Power; it's manifeſt the only way to anſwer this Deſign, is to exert thoſe ſurpriſing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties God has beſtowed.</p>
                  <p>Again, If God did create Man a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Being to make him capable of Happineſs, and put him into a condition of attaining it; It's certain he deſigned him for Happineſs by implanting ſuch
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:135106:49"/>inceſſant Deſires after it; and its certain there is no way of attaining Happineſs, but by purſuing the ſtrict Dictates of Reaſon. Happineſs can conſiſt in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the perfection of our Natures, or in a reſemblance of their primitive Model, and the great Original they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent: And it's Reaſon alone, and a courſe of Action advanced upon it, that can exhibit this Happineſs in its true Lineaments and Proportions.</p>
                  <p>In a Word, Were Happineſs carried no further than the welfare of the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Part; It's certain, that Temperance, that Friendſhip, that Generoſity, and that Juſtice, which Natural Reaſon, from the very frame and condition of our Natures, ſuggeſts and preſcribes, are the only In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments for ſecuring it; therefore we muſt conclude, ſince an <hi>All-wiſe</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Creator</hi> could not act Blindfold; ſince he aſſigned every Order of Creatures peculiar Ends, and eſtabliſh'd a general End from all of 'em; and ſince an All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Creator muſt be concerned to have thoſe Ends anſwered, which he hath aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd; Reaſon muſt be a Rule and a Standard of Action in all Reaſonable Creatures; without which the Ends and Deſigns of Reaſonable Creatures cannot
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:135106:49"/>be attain'd. And thus we have the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Law-giver evinced from the Ends and Deſigns of reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>§.</hi> 7. There is one Argument more that proves the Obligation and Authority of Laws of Nature, and certain Dictates of Reaſon to be ſuch; and that is, From the conſideration of Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments that flow from 'em.</p>
                  <p>It's well known that Rewards and Puniſhments are an inſeparable Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of a Law, and where we are not only directed by a lawful Authority, that this or that thing is to be done, but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards are annexed to the doing of it, and Puniſhments to the omiſſion of it, or at leaſt doing the contrary, there the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is expreſſed and repreſented; and conſequently the thing directed is propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as a Law or Rule of Action. But now it's already concluded, that thoſe Dictates of Reaſon which neceſſarily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from the Frame and Condition of our Natures, carry inſeparable Rewards in 'em, and the Violation of 'em entails inſeparable Miſchiefs or Puniſhments up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us; and therefore ſuch Dictates of Reaſon do as evidently declare the Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:135106:50"/>of the Law-giver, and the Obligation of Laws, as if we were told it by an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible Voice from Heaven: And thus we have aſſerted the Authority of Laws of Nature, being the laſt Requiſite aſſigned for the Proof of 'em. And, truly, there are ſo many Arguments ſuggeſt it, that we may as well deny that we can Think by Nature, as be ignorant of the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Laws of Nature.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>§.</hi> 8. But, after all that has been ſaid concerning the Authority of Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſome perhaps will imagine that the Arguments already ſuggeſted, are rather the Improvements of Reaſon, under a State of Revelation, and the Diſcipline of a civilized Education, than the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of Reaſon, in a pure State of Nature. I muſt confeſs, it is difficult to diſtinguiſh the pure Efforts of Natural Reaſon from thoſe Improvements ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives from Revelation, and a poliſhed Education; but certainly we may appeal to Revelation itſelf, for the Authority of Laws of Nature, and particularly that the Dictates of Natural Reaſon are to be the Meaſure and Standard of our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For, firſt, Conſcience we know is the Reſult and Decree of Reaſon; and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:135106:50"/>this is advanc'd to ſuch an abſolute Sovereignty in the Chriſtian Inſtitution, that we cannot reject the Inſtructions of an erroneous Conſcience, without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailing Sin and Guilt upon us. For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Heathens and Unbelievers, <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is not of Faith is Sin;</hi> and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it amounts to a Demonſtration, That if God has given no other Rule to Reaſonable Beings, but Reaſon to act by, we muſt conclude, that Reaſon muſt be the Standard of Action; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently every one is under an Indiſpenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Obligation of purſuing it, unleſs we can imagine we are not to exert Actions peculiar to our Nature, or that God has not as induſtriouſly diſtinguiſhed the Actions of Men from thoſe of Brutes, as their Souls and Shape too. In a word, whoſoever owns the Truth and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Chriſtian Inſtitutions, muſt diſcern the Truth and Authority of Laws of Nature; for he may plainly read both in the great End and Deſign of Chriſtianity; for the whole OEconomy of Grace conſiſts in reſtoring the OEco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of Nature, and renewing that I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of our Minds, in which we were created; or which is the ſame thing, in the Apoſtle's Language, <hi>In being renewed
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:135106:51"/>in Knowledge after the Image of him that created him,</hi> Col. 3.10. In a word, Chriſtianity is the <hi>putting on the New Man, which, after God, is created in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and true Holineſs;</hi> and the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the New Man, is the putting on the firſt Man that was formed after the Image of God, <hi>in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs;</hi> therefore we muſt conclude, that Model which God impreſs'd on our Nature was deſign'd to be a Law, and a Rule, or Standard to our Actions, and conſequently the Powers of Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, wou'd have thought it to be a Law, had Revelation never interpoſed in the Matter. Thus we have proved, that there is a Law of Nature, even in all the Circumſtances and Formalities of a Law; it's a Law diſtinct from the Law of Revelation, ſince it ariſes, and is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to us by pure Dint of Natural Reaſon; it's a true and proper Law, for it contains the Matter and Form of a proper Law, the Subject-matter is fix'd and determin'd. It has the Form of a Law, becauſe it determines what is to be done, and that too upon a juſt and competent Authority, and when all this is granted, it gives us the Sanctions of a Law, I mean Rewards and Puniſhments.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:135106:51"/>For if Reaſon dictates certain indiſpenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Rules of Action, from the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Will and Pleaſure of a Sovereign Creator, Reaſon muſt, beſides thoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Rewards and Puniſhments that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the Obſervance of ſuch Rules, at leaſt acknowledge, That the Non-obſervance of 'em, muſt bring Guilt and Puniſhment upon us. And therefore I ſee nothing wanting (notwithſtanding Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>'s Notions of a Law) to give it the Title and Denomination of a proper Law. For it's as much, <hi>Vox imperantis,</hi> and as truly promulg'd, as if it had been recorded in Writing, or engraved on Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of Braſs.</p>

               </head>
               <p>IT now only remains, that ſomething be offered to take off the Force of thoſe Objections, that are advanced againſt this Hypotheſis, of a Law of Nature excluſive of Revelation. The Sum of which is, in a few words, this:</p>
               <p>Whatſoever has been hitherto attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Powers of Natural Reaſon, ſeems to exiſt no where but in the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of Speculative Men. For not only the Lives and Opinions of Heathen Nations, but of the moſt eminent Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts and Phyloſophers have overturned the Scheme, and paſſed off the Stage of the World under the Conduct of quite oppoſite Notions. This is an Objection that will fall in with other parts of this Diſcourſe, and conſequently will require ſomething of a Return under each re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Head; but that I may lay a Foundation for a clear and diſtinct An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, I ſhall take liberty to make a few Remarks upon the <hi>Origin</hi> of <hi>Error.</hi>
               </p>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:135106:52"/>
                  <p>§. 1. And, firſt, it's a very unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable Truth, that the Errors of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are originally founded in vicious Habits or Immoralities; or to ſpeak in other Terms, the Seeds of this kind of Corruption are certainly lodged in the Propenſions and Habits of the Animal Part. For that which has ſuch an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent over us, to command us to Act in favour of it, will infallibly influence our Judgments. This is ſo obvious, that in wilful Enormities, I mean ſuch as were firſt committed againſt the Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Mind, the Power of Animal Propenſions, Aſſiduity of Practice, and a kind of Natural Intimacy or Famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity reſulting from it, has at laſt enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Reaſon itſelf to appear as an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate for it; and very often it makes ſuch elaborate Reſearches for Arguments to ſupport the Cauſe, that at laſt it declares for the Juſtice and Innocence of it, and aſſerts it upon Principle and inward Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction. I am perſwaded, and can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out breach of Charity or Juſtice, affirm, That the Growth of the fouleſt Hereſies in the Chriſtian World is to be placed in this Original. Men have ſo long given the full Reins to Pride, Ambition, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:135106:53"/>or other vitious Luſts and Propenſions, that they have called in their whole Stock of Parts and Learning, and made Converts to their Judgments to ſupport them, or revenge their Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments.</p>
                  <p>And now, upon this Bottom, we may ſilence all Objections brought from the abſurd, and Heterodox Opinions of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Moraliſts and Philoſophers. For, it's highly probable, they were at firſt but exquiſite Apologies to Patronize impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Paſſions and confirm'd Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and conſequently can be no real Prejudices to a Law of Nature. Indeed, the impure Doctrine of the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> may be as well admitted a juſt Plea againſt the Truth and Purity of Chriſtianity, and the Evidences for both, as ſome few lewd Doctrines of Philoſophers againſt the Certainty of a Law of Nature, upon the Evidences of Natural Reaſon.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="section">
                  <p>§. 2. But, to enlarge a little on this part of the Objection, it's well known that the fouleſt and moſt abſurd Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, charged on particular Philoſophers, are by others recorded as an eternal Mark of Infamy and Reproach due to 'em; and conſequently they are by no means
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:135106:53"/>a juſt Balance to the ſubſtantial Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of others, in deciphering Laws of Nature. We might add to all this, how unjuſt a Meaſure the Practices of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind is of their real Notices of Moral Good, an Argument too fatally demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated under a Chriſtian Diſpenſation; and conſequently tho' the Generality of Philoſophers liv'd in Oppoſition to Laws of Nature, and ſome few taught contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to 'em, yet it's no juſt Conſequence to place Laws of Nature above the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearches of Natural Reaſon. I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded ſome of the Inſtances preſented in a late Conference
<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>See</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with a Theiſt, <hi>Part</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 56, to <hi>p.</hi> 64.</note>, do not fall under the Character of prime Laws of Nature; and conſequently do not reach the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Deſign. It's very well known, <hi>Plato</hi>'s Model for Peopling his Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth was not by a Community of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, without Limitations from the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Power. But for the preciſe Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in this matter, as well as the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Worſhiping God, whether by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices and corporeal Repreſentations, I preſume, it's the buſineſs of Revealed Religion to fix and determine. As for his Inſtance of Maſculine Venery, <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> and his Followers pronounced it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different; I preſume it was a previous
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:135106:54"/>Practice that had made it appear ſo. And yet St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of ſome of theſe unnatural Whoredoms as things ſcarce named among the Gentiles, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. But it were highly to be wiſhed that ſome Nations in the Confines of Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endom, had wholly eſcaped the Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; ſo that if ſuch vile Practices in a State of Nature may be an Argument againſt Laws of Nature antecedent to Revelation, it will be of Force againſt written Revelations: Since Laws of Nature founded in the Dictates of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reaſon, may be as eaſily violated as any written Law. Certainly ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed Practices may with greater force of Reaſon be allowed againſt a Law that pretends to no higher Authority than Revelation, or ſupported by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Laſtly, As for the <hi>Grecian</hi> Piece of Cruelty, in expoſing Children to the Mercy of Beaſts, and Travellers, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remorſe, I preſume the Practice was not frequent, becauſe it muſt be the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern and Intereſt of every Government to ſuppreſs it. But it's well known, the Chriſtian World is not wholly freed from ſuch Monſters, who I am afraid are acted by no other Dread but what the Apprehenſions of a Diſcovery, and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:135106:54"/>the Penalties of the Law extort from them. However, this is an Inſtance ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely repugnant to the common Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of Humanity, that it as effectually diſproves thoſe Earnings which natural Inſtinct diſcovers in the whole Order of Brutes towards their own Off-ſpring, as that natural Reaſon diſcovers the ſame Earnings to be a point of Duty to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. In one word, the Cruelties of Heathens is no more an Argument that natural Reaſon doth not teach the contrary, than the Barbarity of ſome particular Chriſtians an Argument, that Chriſtianity does not exhort to Bowels of Compaſſion, and a Parental Care to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their own Off-ſpring.</p>
                  <p>But to return: A ſecond Cauſe of Error is certain Prejudices or Prepoſſeſſions im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed on the Mind by Example and Education. The Cauſe and Origin of Error already given preſents us with the Propenſions and Bias of Humane Nature, and conſequently how liable the World is to be overſpread with Error. At leaſt Matter of Fact informs us how wide the Actions of Men deviate from the Line of Duty, ſo that it may truly be ſaid of the Heathen World, That the <hi>Imaginations of their Hearts is to do Evil
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:135106:55"/>continually.</hi> Certainly then, where a Contagion extends itſelf not only to the Judgments, but Practices of Mankind; and not only corrupt Principles, but vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Examples prevail in Parents, Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians and Tutors, the Minds of their Deſcendents will be deeply impregnated with pernicious Prejudices and Prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions. They are implanted among the firſt and earlieſt Impreſſions, even before the Powers of Reaſon exert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. This, I am confident, is the Caſe of the uncultivated Regions of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: And certainly, when Reaſon comes to exert it ſelf under ſuch a fatal Bias, no wonder if ſhe often falls into very groſs Miſcarriages. And yet this is the inevitable Portion of Mankind, that are brought forth in a State of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence, as well in Mind as Body; and can hardly arrive to any Growth in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, before they arrive to a Maturity in Body. But now, theſe things being laid together, and admitted; it's very unjuſt to reject the Divine Oeconomy of Laws of Nature antecedent to Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe the unavoidable Prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions of ſome Men have carried them beſides the Mark, ſo as to contradict the general Lines of Duty: For, it's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:135106:55"/>were Men to enter the World in the Strength and Power of Reaſon, without the Clog and Encumbrance of antecedent Prepoſſeſſions (as in the Inſtance already given, <hi>See</hi> Chap. 1. Sect. 2.) It's impoſſible but the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Line of Duty muſt preſent it ſelf to the firſt workings of Reaſon; and the prime Laws of Nature would be as legible to the Eye of the Mind, as they would be to the outward Senſes, when graved on Tables of Stone. But now, as the Caſe ſtands, I mean with regard to a degenerate State; the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons before us prove no more than the Miſcarriages of Reaſon, but do not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturn that Frame or Model which God hath eſtabliſhed. So that Reaſon in her Enquiries after a Law of Nature, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be placed under great Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but yet Laws of Nature may, for all this, be the Product, and Workings of natural Reaſon.</p>

               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <p>§. 1. And firſt, it's very obſervable, This <hi>Gentleman</hi> has induſtriouſly amaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed together all the Filth and Off-ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a reprobate Mind, and a defiled Conſcience, and of a People that ſeem'd to be abandoned by God; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently nurſed up in a univerſal Impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety. He has ſent us to all the Creeks and Corners of Barbarity under the Verge
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:135106:56"/>of Heaven, to ſee Rapes, Murders, and the vileſt Inceſts practiſed, with univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Approbation and Allowance; yea, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with an Opinion of Vertue and Merit; to ſee whole Nations or Tribes of Men living <hi>without God in the World,</hi> without any Foot-ſteps of Worſhip, or ſo much as a Name for God. [Lock<hi>'s Humane <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> B. 1.

It's true, were the Doctrine of innate Ideas, or practical Principles no way to be diſproved, but by expoſing the Conceipt of univerſal Conſent, the Method had been very pardonable; but this Author confeſſes, that were the Argument admitted, it proves no Idea or Principle to be innate,</hi> B. 1. Cap. 2. §. 3. <hi>And therefore I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid he was acted by no good Deſign, to muſter up all his Forces against an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that does him no Diſſervice, eſpecially when his Methods of attacking it, are more fatal against the whole Body of Morality.</hi> But to make ſome Returns to theſe Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues, I ſhall not now conſider how far practical Principles may be ſaid to be innate, this will fall in its proper place; but I think we have no reaſon to caſhier the Argument of univerſal Conſent, which if there is any ſuch
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:135106:58"/>thing, muſt be a conſiderable Evidence of a Law of Nature, and the irreconcila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Diſtinctions of Good and Evil. And firſt, I think Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> needed not to have ſent us to <hi>Africa</hi> and the <hi>Indies,</hi> to the moſt rude and uncultivated Parts of the World, to explode the Doctrine of an univerſal Conſent, as to Chaſtity, Humanity, and other moral Vertues. For the ſacred Canon, if he will allow it to be Authentick, would have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed him with national Enormities that were as much the Faſhion of their Countries and the approved Rules of Living, as any he has produced. Did not the ſeven Nations practiſe the vileſt Inceſts, was it not a piece of Devotion to ſacrifice there Off-ſpring to <hi>Moloch,</hi> See <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23. and in a word, to practiſe a thouſand Abominations? As for particular Nations that had not ſo much as a Name of God (if in reality there were any ſuch) I think they were not more remarkable, than thoſe <hi>that had not God in all their Thoughts.</hi> And when the vileſt Immoralities are produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with a national Eſteem and Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, I think they are not worſe than thoſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> has charged the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then World with, in more places than
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:135106:58"/>one, <hi>who being past Feeling, have given themſelves over to Laſciviouſneſs, to work all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs with greedineſs.</hi> [See <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. v. 18, 19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. v. 20, 25.] and yet I think there can be no juſt Authority againſt an Univerſal Conſent, as to Laws of Nature, or Practical Principles. If this were ſo, Univerſal Conſent may be as well rejected in the Proof of Rational Faculties, or at leaſt in the Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Reaſon and Truth upon any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Foundation; and conſequently they are to be reſolved into meer Chance or Fortune: for the Contradictions (recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by St. <hi>Paul</hi>) to the plain Rules of Morality, are as abſolute Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Allowance or Suppoſition of Rational Faculties, and the natural Frame and Foundation of Reaſon, as they are to Laws of Nature, or the natural Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Good and Evil. The Miſtake, I think, is obvious from a very few Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, tho' God has implanted Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of Reaſon, which, if rightly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed and applied, will diſcern Things as they really are, and pronounce certain Matters or Things, indiſpenſable Rules of Action: Yet, ſince there's a fatal Bias on our Natures, and theſe Faculties do not Act neceſſarily, nor are Things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:135106:59"/>duly preſented to their View, nor do they yield a due Attention to 'em; No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be impreſſed, that may almoſt overturn the very Frame of Nature, or deſtroy the natural Appearances of Good and Evil, Vice and Vertue; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Men may by the Bias of Education, Cuſtom, and irregular Appetites, come to eſpouſe the moſt horrid Impieties, for Heroick Vertues; may practiſe the groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt Enormities, not only with Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, but an Opinion of Merit. I'm ſure Chriſtianity ſuppoſes little leſs, when we are aſſured of <hi>Seared Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; when the Mind, or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings, as well as Conſciences, may be defiled,</hi> Tit. 1.3. when the Underſtanding may be darkned (to that degree) as to <hi>be past Feeling,</hi> and to <hi>give us up to work all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs with greedineſs.</hi> And in a word, when we are inſtructed that Men may be abandoned by God, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may be given up <hi>to walk in the Vanity of their Minds, to vile Affections,</hi> and <hi>to work all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs.</hi> This may be the Caſe of private Perſons, and of publick Societies too; and no doubt it is the Caſe of the miſerable <hi>Indians</hi> at this Day, as it was once of the Seven Nations. And when ſuch invincible Ignorance and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:135106:59"/>has over-ſpread a Land, and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an eſtabliſhed Rule of Life to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, Governours and Tutors, it muſt (without ſome diſtinguiſhing Overtures of Grace) be entailed and tranſmitted to Poſterity. But yet for all this the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Univerſal Conſent, as to Laws of Nature and eſtabliſhed Rules of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, cannot juſtly be Arrained, we may as well queſtion Man to be a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Creature, at leaſt on the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Univerſal Conſent, becauſe there are ſome Fools and Ideots; or a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Symetry and Proportion, becauſe there are ſome Monſters in the World; as argue againſt an Univerſal Conſent, becauſe the Barbarity of ſome Nations contradict it. It's true, Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to take off the force of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſince he ſeems to call the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of other Nations, that have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the great Lines of Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the <hi>private Perſwaſions of a Party;</hi> whilſt we eſteem 'em the only Dictates of Right Reaſon, <hi>B.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. §. 20. But I hope thoſe vile Practices he has tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed from thoſe that only retain the Figure of Men, are not to paſs for the <hi>Dictates of Right Reaſon,</hi> nor they <hi>the Men of Right Reaſon:</hi> And conſequently
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:135106:60"/>their Votes or Opinions are not to be received againſt that Univerſal Conſent we contend for, for certainly, when we appeal to Univerſal Conſent, we cannot be ſuppoſed to appeal to Monſters, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtates, Reprobates or Devils; and yet there may be whole Nations that will fall under one of theſe Characters. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, It's poſſible that natural Powers and Faculties may be ſo far abuſed, as to loſe their native Vigour and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity; ſo that Men may live in a State of Inconſideration and Thoughtleſſneſs, and become as Ignorant and Careleſs of every Thing, but what the Example and Cuſtom of their Country ſuggeſts, as the unthinking Brute that periſheth. And this may be the caſe of Tribes of Men as well as private Perſons, and no doubt is the caſe of the uncultivated Negro's; and therefore it would be highly abſurd to take in their Judgments and Opinions, to make up that Univerſal Conſent we contend for.</p>

                  <p>§. 2. Upon the whole then, when we have recourſe to Univerſal Conſent, for the Proof of a Law of Nature, it only implies an Appeal to thoſe Nations or People, that in the Judgment of impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:135106:60"/>Reaſon, have paſſed under the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Poliſhed or Civilized; or that have been juſtly ſuppoſed in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to have exerted thoſe Powers and Faculties in Thought and Obſervation, which God has implanted in the original Frame and Conſtitution of Mankind. And certainly we have always had the joynt Conſent of ſuch Nations, for moſt of thoſe Rules and Precepts, which, in the ſtricteſt Senſe, are eſteemed Laws of Nature: I'm ſure they have ſignified or declared it in the moſt unqueſtionable Way or Manner; Inasmuch as they have been ſelected for the general Subject of civil Laws, and the Practice of 'em en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced by certain civil Penalties or Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And certainly this is the ſtrongeſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument or Preſumption for Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that may be, ſince we cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, why diſtinct Nations and Societies of Men, eſtabliſhed upon different Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims and Rules of Policy, as well as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels of Government, ſhould conſpire in the Subject-matter of ſo many Laws; unleſs they were by the Light of Reaſon diſcoverable to Mankind, as indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable Rules of Action.

                  <p>§. 1. HAving in ſome meaſure drawn the Line, and laid the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of natural Religion, or Laws of Nature antecedent to Revelation, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but diſcover my Diſſatisfactions with the Opinion of a late Author, that pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the Whole of natural Religion in the Authority of Revelation, that will allow it no other Original but Revelation, and no other Means of Conveyance and Preſervation, but Oral Tradition. [See Conference with a Theiſt, <hi>Part</hi> 2. <hi>Page</hi> 32. 36.] Indeed this ſeems to be a Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on advanced without well conſidering the Nature, Probability, or Conſequences of it. For firſt, the manner of its Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance by Oral Tradition (which this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor was forced to admit of) ſeems to expoſe it as a groundleſs Conjecture. I know he endeavours to remove the Force
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:135106:61"/>of this Argument, by telling us, That <hi>the Duties that paſs under the Characters of Laws of Nature, are ſo natural to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, ſo eaſie to be embraced by it, and upon Propoſal ſeem ſo to be extreamly <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeful to Mankind, that they must be aſſented to, and can never be miſtaken or forgot,</hi> p. 36. And conſequently there was not the leaſt neceſſity of any written Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords. But certainly this is a Confeſſion, which if well conſidered, ſhould have directed him to the very Notion he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to expoſe. For if Laws of Nature are ſo natural and obvious to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that they muſt be aſſented to, he might very well have allowed that their extream Uſefulneſs to Mankind would have prompted and enabled Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to have made the Diſcovery, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out borrowing the whole from Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Certainly, if Reaſon, by its own intrinſic Light and Activity, could not go thus far, he muſt ſuppoſe the Souls of Men, tho' <hi>God's expreſs Image and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative,</hi> to be the moſt imperfect, impotent Parts of the Creation. But then that Laws of Nature are not ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſented to, or can never be miſtaken or forgot, I ſhould have thought his own Remarks upon the Lives and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:135106:62"/>of Philoſophers, and in a word, on the Manners and Notions of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then World, had been a ſufficient Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation. Moſt of theſe, we muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, received ſomething from his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Line of Tradition, and therefore ſince he has made 'em ſo baſely to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Rules of it, he might have juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concluded that Providence, who knew well what was in Man, muſt have judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it neceſſary to have inculcated Laws of Nature, either by frequent Viſions, or committed them to Writing, as well as the other parts of his revealed Will. And therefore his own Objection ſeems to ſtand good againſt him, on his own Principles: <hi>That Tradition is not ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per a means to convey Morality by to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, becauſe of its liableneſs to Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that it would have been more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly vitiated than we find it is, had it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended by this Method.</hi> And truly the Objection carries force in it, for were Humane Reaſon ſo deſperately Impotent, as the Picture he ſeems to have preſented the World with, repreſents; I cannot conceive what Service a few blind Oral Traditions would have done to preſerve the leaſt Footſteps of Morality. But to examine the Truth of the Conjecture,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:135106:62"/>under the Inſtance he has given, that of the <hi>Indian.</hi> Indeed it's very notorious the Regions of the <hi>Indian</hi> World are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the loweſt Ebb of Humanity, and lodged under the groſſeſt Cloud of Ignorance, there being not much left but Humane Shape to introduce a Thinking Mind to believe they are endued with Humane Souls. But as for thoſe ſmall Remains of Morality, were they to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to a ſtrict Examination, I'm perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, we ſhould hardly find them Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving 'em into the Advice or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of their Fathers and Grandfathers, or pretending a Succeſſion from the great Parent of Mankind, <hi>Adam.</hi> This is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly an Account as unknown and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought of, as native Inſcriptions, or a <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionale</hi> founded in a large train of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. But yet tho' 'tis ridiculous to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magin that ſuch illiterate Mortals ſhould reſolve every Term or Notion into its Simple Ideas, (eſpecially ſuch as a late Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has projected) yet I do not queſtion, but they would offer at ſomething from the Intrinſic Nature of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that would determine and engage their Choices; ſomething that would in ſome meaſure beſpeak them Men, and Reaſonable Creatures. I will grant that
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:135106:63"/>Opinion as well as Practice may be often eſtabliſhed upon Cuſtom and publick Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, without accounting for the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or Reaſon of the Things themſelves. But then Cuſtom conducts us to ſome Original that is not very remote, where we may find it eſtabliſhed on the higheſt Convictions and Evidences of Reaſon; and it may be no leſs than what are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to eſtabliſh a Law of Nature. But it ſeems highly abſurd, that the whole Body of Laws of Nature, or the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſable Rules of Action to Mankind, ſhould reſt upon no other Foundation, but a few Inſtructions delivered to our Firſt Parents; and theſe tranſmitted thro' all the Periods of Time, and all the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of States, and Kingdoms into all the Corners of the Earth, upon the volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Reports of thoſe that lived before us. As for the Caſe of the poor <hi>Indians,</hi> I'm abundantly ſatisfied, they are ſo little ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of any Conveyance of this Nature, and ſuch inſuperable Obſtructions againſt the Succeſs, or Preſervation of it; that they might, on this account, juſtly plead invincible Ignorance to every Law of Nature, and conſequently free 'emſelves from that ſevere Sentence of <hi>Periſhing without Law,</hi> becauſe they really <hi>Sinned</hi>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:135106:63"/>without the leaſt Apprehenſion, or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of a Law.</hi> Thus far as to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probability of the Conveyance by Oral Tradition.</p>

                  <p>§. 2. I ſhall, in the ſecond place, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſomething, as to the Truth of the Poſition, that Laws of Nature take their Riſe from Revelation.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, I think it manifeſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts the revealed <hi>Canon.</hi> And for this, I ſhall refer this Reverend Author to the Arguments I have advanced from Scripture, and particularly to the Paſſage he has cited, and my Explication pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuant to the whole Body of Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and the beſt Modern Divines upon it. Indeed, he would make the World believe, he has taken off the Force of it, and eſtabliſhed his own Notion by a parallel Text of Scripture: <hi>And theſe Words, which I command thee this Day, ſhall be in thine Heart, and thou ſhalt Teach them diligently to thy Children,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. v. 6, 7. Whereas, it's manifeſt, the holy Spirit ſpeaks of Laws Revealed and Recorded, and the writing in the Heart implies nothing but a treaſuring 'em up in the Mind, a Commitment of them to the Memory; and, in a Word, nothing
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:135106:64"/>but what the bleſſed Mother of our Lord did on another Occaſion, when ſhe <hi>laid up his</hi> heavenly <hi>Sayings in her Heart.</hi> It expreſſes a Duty incumbent upon us to commit the Laws of God to our Minds and Conſciences, to rivet 'em in our Hearts and Affections, ſo to Meditate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, that we may perform and keep them, and inſtruct others in them. But the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans</hi> expreſſes a quite different thing. It expreſſes a Law diſtinct from a Revealed Law, and fixes the Diſtinction in the different manner of Promulgation, on the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the Heart; ſo that if 'tis not done by native Inſcriptions, it muſt by natural Powers and Faculties. But fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Canon of Scripture does not only pronounce this Notion falſe and groundleſs, but, I preſume, it has been in ſome meaſure demonſtrated to be ſo. For, if Man is originally endued with ſuch Faculties, as by a native Activity can exert 'emſelves in the Diſcovery of Laws of Nature, there can be no Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for erecting an uncertain Scheme of Oral Tradition.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="3" type="section">
                  <p>§. 3. But to proceed to the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of this Poſition.</p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:135106:64"/>
                  <p>And firſt, It's very well known, the Patrons of this Notion directly overturn the received Diſtinctions of Natural, from Revealed Religion, and Natural from Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Laws. The Diſtinction was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways founded in the different Origin of theſe Laws. The latter being given by ſpecial Revelation, but the former diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the Workings of Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. But now both muſt derive from Revelation; and conſequently there can be no other Diſtinction, but what may be among written Revealed Laws: in as much as one Revealed Law or Precept, in its Intrinſic Nature, may be better adapted to the View and Perception of Humane Underſtanding than others; or at leaſt no other Diſtinction, but what lies between Oral, and Written Traditions.</p>
                  <p>But to conclude this Argument, This Notion ſeems to ſhake or overturn the eternal Diſtinctions of Moral Good and Evil, founded in the very Frame and Nature of Things, together with the OEconomy of Natural Conſcience. For, it's manifeſt, it weakens the Authority of Natural Religion, by placing ſuch important Laws and Precepts upon the ſlender Credit of Oral Traditions. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there are ſo many Difficulties and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:135106:65"/>Improbabilities in tranſmitting a Body of Laws, through all Parts of the Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table World, by Oral Traditions, as are ſufficient to ruine the Credit of the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis; and when this is done, the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinarian has the greateſt Advantage gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, to reſolve the Whole of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Religion into <hi>Cuſtom</hi> and <hi>Education:</hi> Theſe are Conſiderations ſo obvious and clear, as might have given an early Check to the Notion, unleſs more cogent Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and Authorities had diſcovered themſelves, than have been hitherto pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. However, now, I preſume, they may obtain their due Effect, and though they have been offered with a great deal of Freedom, yet I hope this will not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct their Admiſſion, where they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry an Evidence ſufficient to make way for it.</p>

                  <p>§. 1. I Proceed, in the next place, to fix the Diſtinction of Laws of Nature, from Poſitive, or Written Laws, and conſider whether they are Innate or no.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, The Diſtinction of Laws of Nature from Laws which, in the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Senſe, paſs under the Name of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, is clearly viſible. For in Laws of Nature, as well the Subject matter, as the Authority of the Law, or the Mind, and Intention of the Law-giver upon it, are diſcoverable by the Powers and Faculties of Natural Reaſon. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, in Revealed Laws, (I mean ſuch as in the higheſt Senſe are ſtiled Revealed) both the Subject-matter, and Intention of the Law-giver, entirely depend on the expreſs Will and Pleaſure of God. If
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:135106:66"/>there's any Difficulty then, it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in fixing the preciſe Diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, and Human Laws. For its certain both are to be eſteemed the Deductions and Decrees of Right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. But, I think, they are chiefly to be diſtinguiſhed from the Subject-matter of them. It's indeed the Work of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reaſon to diſcover, and fix the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject-matter of theſe Laws; but the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject-matter of Laws of Nature is often vaſtly different from that of Civil Laws: For the Subject-matter of Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ariſing from the original Frame and Condition of our Natures, and for the moſt part immediately conducing to our very Beings or Subſiſtence, rather than Well-being or civil Happineſs, it ſeems to carry a natural and intrinſic Goodneſs; and conſequently an irreſiſtible Force and Efficacy in it, abſtracting from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, or Injunctions of a Law-giver. But now the Subject-matter of Civil Laws being chiefly the Circumſtantials, or Inſtruments of the improved Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of particular Societies; and calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated for the particular Genius and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of Men under different Climates, as well as the particular Turns and Periods of Kingdoms and Governments; it often
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:135106:66"/>carries no Intrinſick Goodneſs in it, but is juſtly to be rank'd among Things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; till the Pleaſure and Authority of the Law-giver paſſes upon it. Again, the Subject-matter of Civil Laws, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly variable; whereas that of Laws of Nature ſeems to be perpetual and unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable. For ſince the Subject-matter of Laws of Nature reſults from the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Frame and Order of created Nature, or indeed, from the original Frame of Humane Nature, as it ſtands encompaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with common Wants and Neceſſities; it muſt neceſſarily be adapted to the whole Off-ſpring of Mankind, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently be as perpetual as univerſal. But now the Subject-matter of Humane Laws being only the Circumſtantials of civil Happineſs, advanced as a fit and proper Inſtrument to attain it in particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities and Societies of Men, it muſt needs be precarious and changeable; it's often calculated for particular Events and Emergencies, and conſequently is as va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious as the different Aſpects, or Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Kingdoms. It's an Inſtrument often advanced for a particular, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary End and Deſign, and it's well known there may be Twenty Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of equal force to attain it; and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:135106:67"/>conſequently the Subject-matter of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws is often no otherwiſe fix'd and determin'd, than by the arbitrary Decree or Sentence of the Law-giver. But further, in order to eſtabliſh a true Diſtinction of Laws of Nature from poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Humane Laws; let us conſider what it is that ſeems to give 'em the Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Laws of Nature, and repreſents 'em as Innate Rules, or Principles.</p>
                  <p>And Firſt, ſince it is concluded, that they reſult, or take their riſe from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Frame and Conſtitution of created Nature, (inſomuch, that God having eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed the Frame and Order of Things, theſe Laws, without any poſitive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, muſt follow upon it; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in one Act ſeems to have eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed both) they may be juſtly eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Laws of Nature. And this may be one principal Reaſon why they carry the appearance of Innate Principles, and in the ſacred <hi>Canon</hi> are repreſented to us as ſuch. In this Senſe, I'm ſure, they are ſufficiently diſtinguiſh'd from Humane Laws, ſince they are ſo far from taking their riſe in the Frame and Conſtitution of Nature, that they are, at beſt, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Deductions from Laws of Nature, or rather certain temporary Rules and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:135106:67"/>of Reaſon advanced upon particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Emergencies in conformity to Laws of Nature, or, at leaſt, an arbitrary en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement of Laws of Nature by poſitive Rewards and Puniſhments. But further, that which in reality gives them the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Innate Principles and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination of Laws of Nature, is the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and perſpicuity of 'em. For ſince it is concluded, that Laws of Nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult from the very Frame and Order of Nature, from that ſtate and condition of Things wherein we were born, and whereby we ſubſiſt; they muſt undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly diſcover 'emſelves to the Minds of Men, even tho' they were lodged in the moſt ſimple and unimproved State of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For as long as we allow Mankind to be Thinking Reaſoning Beings, the deſire of Self-preſervation will direct 'em to thoſe Laws, without the obſervance of which they can hardly pretend to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, much leſs be happy. In a word, they are Laws of Nature, becauſe they are Impreſſions that are ſtamped on the Mind, from the moſt importunate cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings and exigencies of Nature; and they carry the appearance of Innate Principles, becauſe they are certainly ſome of the firſt Suggeſtions that accompany a Mind af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:135106:68"/>its arrived to a State of Thinking, and left to conſult the Safety and Preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the whole Man: I ſay they are certainly ſome of the firſt Suggeſtions that would naturally offer 'emſelves to the Minds of Men. For tho' Mankind is brought forth in Impotence, and their Mind cultivated by Education, as their Bodies are cheriſhed by Food and Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, till they arrive to a competent Strength and Vigor, and conſequently Names, and Words, and Ideas of the moſt trite Objects of Senſe are inſtilled by the Inſtructions of Nurſes and Parents, yet could we ſuppoſe Men turned out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World in a State of Maturity, without the Bias of Education upon 'em, I do not queſtion but the very Frame and Condition of their Beings, together with the Deſire of Self-preſervation, would give 'em a ſpeedy View of thoſe Laws, which, for this Reaſon, are juſtly ſtiled Laws of Nature. Again, they are Laws of Nature; becauſe they immediately fall in with ſome peculiar Propenſions; wrought off with the original Frame and Conſtitution of our Natures. It's viſible there are certain Inſtincts, or Impulſes in Nature, which ſeem to exert 'emſelves upon particular Actions, that cannot well
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:135106:68"/>be reſolved into the elaborate Workings of Reaſon, for they ſeem to have enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Paſſions by a kind of influential Impulſe before the Action can well be ſcanned by any deliberate Reaſonings; and certainly nothing ſtrikes the Paſſions ſooner, than thoſe Actions that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd by Laws of Nature. Thus the receipt of Benefits creates a ſpeedy exulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the cheriſhing of our own Off-ſpring leaves a vigorous Complacency, and the moſt grateful Applauſes and Satisfactions. And truly theſe are Things that have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcovered 'emſelves ſo early, where Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has not been new moulded by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Habits, or Education, that I do not queſtion but they have given a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to pronounce Laws of Nature, natural Inſtincts, or Innate Doctrines, or Principles. To conclude this Argument, Another diſtinguiſhing Characteriſtick of Laws of Nature from Civil Laws, ariſes from the exerciſe of Reaſon in the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of 'em. It's on all hands allowed, that Reaſon is the immediate Directory in Civil Laws, as well as Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But yet Reaſon acts in a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent manner. For the Foundation of Laws of Nature being the common exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, neceſſities, or condition of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:135106:69"/>as Men, or ſuch an Order of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; Reaſon can eaſily fix ſuch Rules as will extend to the whole Species, ſo as to carry a binding Authority over 'em. But the Foundation of Civil Laws being only ſome particular Emergencies to be conſidered with regard to ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Circumſtances of Time, Place, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and the like; Reaſon cannot deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min any thing abſolutely, or ſix a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rule, or, indeed, declare what is fit and convenient in every Community; and conſequently Civil Laws can only be the Deductions of Reaſon in Civil Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, with regard to the State and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of their People, or Government where they preſide.</p>

                  <p>§. 1. HAving thus aſſigned the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Characteriſticks of Laws of Nature, we may in a few Words deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, whether there be any practical Principles, which are truly Innate: But before I ſhall conclude any thing, I ſhall take liberty to make ſome few Returns to the Arguments of a late Author on this Subject. [<hi>Mr.</hi> Lock's <hi>Eſſay concerning Human <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi>] And firſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Univerſal Conſent. It's indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putably evident, that Univerſal Conſent does not prove any Ideas, or practical Principles to be Innate. Becauſe an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Conſent may prevail, partly from that Self-evidence, that naturally reſults from particular Things, or Actions, when preſented to the Minds of Men; and partly from the Frame and Condition of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:135106:70"/>Human Nature; whereby we are forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly prompted to the diſquiſition of 'em. But yet we are not willing wholly to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcard the Argument; becauſe tho' Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Conſent may not prove the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Innate Ideas; yet it's certainly a conſiderable Argument of a Law of Nature. And tho' the Author of this Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay has done all he could to ruine the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and Authority of it, yet I hope I have proved there is ſuch a thing as Univerſal Conſent, eſtabliſhed upon a very firm and clear Foundation. But further, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Arguments of this Author are chiefly advanced againſt Innate Ideas, but they appear with equal force againſt Innate practical Principles. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall remark a little on that which he ſeems to fix the greateſt weight on; and that is, a Neceſſity of Perception, even in a State of Infancy; <hi>for to him it ſeems a Contradiction, or hardly intelligible, that Truths ſhould be imprinted on the Soul which it perceives or underſtands not.</hi> Sect. 5. p. 5. See pag. 13. Sect. 27. But certainly he cannot mean a Neceſſity of actual Perception. For the Finite Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Human Mind, will not in the ſame Inſtant ſuffer many Objects to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived under an actual View; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:135106:70"/>experience informs us, that a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Impreſſions, or Ideas, are lodged in the Memory, without being revived it may be for a ſucceſſion of Years. And truly I can ſee no reaſon, why native Inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may not remain without being actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally attended to, as well as written Laws, or acquir'd Ideas. It's well known, thoſe that contend for Innate Ideas, or Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, do not think they diſcover 'emſelves without the Exerciſe of our natural Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Faculties; and ſome of thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Means and Inſtruments that are neceſſary to acquired Knowledge.</p>
                  <p>In a word, they always ſuppoſe a due Attention and Application of Mind, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Exerciſe of Reflection. And truly ſince acquired Impreſſions, that are laid up in the Memory, are ſcarce e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver revived, but by an accidental Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of ſome preſent Object; theſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Inſcriptions (if any ſuch) may not be perceived till their reſpective Objects are preſented to the Mind, to exert its Powers and Faculties upon. Something like this our Exercitations on written Laws ſeem to reſemble, when we never apprehend the full Force and Purport of a Law, till ſome ſpecial Caſe or Inſtance offers itſelf to induce an Application.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:135106:71"/>And thus the want of Perception in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants may be fairly accounted for; as well as from the infant Indiſpoſitions of the Animal part: For the Organs being (for ought we know) at firſt not ſo well fitted to convey the Images of outward Objects, and conſequently fix any Impreſſions, or eſtabliſh any clear Perceptions, no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if native Inſcriptions lie dormant. This Author allows, there's a time when a Human Soul begins to Think, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe any of its natural Powers and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties; and native Inſcriptions cannot occur, or be perceived before we begin to Think; yea, rather if they are to be revived by the Exerciſe of the Mind, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on outward Things or Objects that are peculiar to 'em; we can ſcarce expect 'em among our infant Thoughts, or mental Exercitations, as long as we are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly entertained by the Inventions of Nurſes and Parents. Thus far there ſeems to be no neceſſity for diſcarding innate Ideas or practical Principles; and conſequently, if it appears that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine ſerves any real Purpoſes of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, I ſee nothing advanced by this Author that demonſtrates the Abſurdity of it.</p>

                  <p>§. 2. But yet for all this, if it be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed that Probabilities may determine our Judgments in this Matter, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Innate Ideas, is rather to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected than retain'd. It's abundantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, That Man is under an eſtabliſht Method of attaining the right knowledge of Good and Evil; the Frame and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Things within and without, with the exerciſe of his own Faculties upon 'em, will preſent him with a Scheme of Moral Duty, and a true Meaſure of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that too as clearly as if it was impreſſed on the Mind, with the firſt Lineaments of its Being: And therefore there ſeems to be no viſible Neceſſity for having Recourſe to Innate Ideas, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions. And certainly, if Innate I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas are ſerviceable to Mankind, they muſt be ſo in order to ſupply the Defects of Reaſon, and conſequently, they ſeem to be exempt from the Diſquiſitions of Reaſon. For if Innate Ideas are to be examined and judged on by the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Reaſon, Reaſon itſelf, (I mean the Decrees and Deductions of it,) will anſwer all the Ends and Deſigns of a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Being as effectually, as if a Digeſt of Laws were originally recorded on the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:135106:72"/>Mind. If this be true, as I think it's, in ſome meaſure, demonſtrated to be, the Doctrine of Innate Principles muſt be laid aſide, ſince we cannot conceive that a wiſe Creator ſhould eſtabliſh any Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, without ſome ſpecial Ends and Uſes annexed to it, I mean ſuch, as are not ſerved any other way. If it be ſaid, that Reaſon exerciſes no Juriſdiction in this Affair; then, I'm afraid, Innate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions will rather endamage than ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance Religion and Morality. For then every one will be apt to obtrude his own Fancies, and wild Suggeſtions, for na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Inſcriptions; and conſequently, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind muſt be expoſed to all the Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies of Enthuſiaſm, in the Oeconomy of Nature, as well as that of Grace; ſo that whatſoever any one has the boldneſs to affirm, or fancy to be written on the Heart, muſt immediately paſs an Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation on all Mens Actions; and the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God ſhall be pleaded to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the common Principles of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, as the Spirit of God has been to the Subverſion of the Peace and Unity of the Church. When all things then are thus fairly laid together, we may with greater appearance of Reaſon, conclude, That our Ideas and Principles are acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:135106:72"/>as well as the more remote Deductions of Science, and that 'tis their intimate A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement with the Ends and Intereſts, or common Frame and Neceſſity of our Nature, that gives 'em the appearance of native Impreſſions. In a word, then, tho' the ſacred Language ſeems to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the Notion, yet it may be juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved into Metaphor, or Figure, and import no more than an Alluſion to the general Cuſtom of promulging Laws in Tables, or Writing. Inaſmuch as God has originally endued us with Powers and Faculties to diſcover a Rule of Action, and Law to Govern ourſelves by, in the common Exigences of Human Nature, as clearly as if he had Engraven it on Tables of Stone.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>Of the different Degrees of the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Laws of Nature.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT will eaſily be granted, that Laws of Nature carry a different Evidence, in proportion to the Subject-matter of 'em, and the ſeveral Workings of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in the Diſquiſition of 'em. Some Laws diſcover 'emſelves by a ſingle Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, or a ſhort train of Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whilſt others reſt upon an Evidence, that is wrought by ſeveral Gradations, or a large Series of Conſequences or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions. The primary Laws of Nature are thoſe which repreſent the principal Duties we owe to God, or thoſe which concern our own Perſons, or the Perſons of our Neighbours. For thoſe that ariſe from our own, or our Neighbours Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, are certainly more elaborate and remote. I ſhall illuſtrate theſe Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by a ſingle Inſtance in each of 'em.</p>
               <p>And firſt, To Reverence and Worſhip the Supreme Being, which we call God, is certainly a Fundamental Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:135106:73"/>becauſe it neceſſarily ariſes from that Relation we bear to God. For the moſt obvious Notion of a God, and a bare Aſſent to this ſingle Propoſition, that God is our Creator, and we his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, from whom all that we have, or belongs to us, is immediately derived, muſt by a direct and immediate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence demonſtrate, that we are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to empty our Souls before him in the moſt ſolemn Acts of Homage and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Indeed, as for the manner of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip, tho' Natural Reaſon, by a train of Arguments, might determine it, ſo as to be ſome way acceptable to God; yet to eſtabliſh it in Perfection, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the buſineſs of Revealed Religion: But that God is to be Worſhipped, is a Duty lodged in the moſt ſimple Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Reaſon. Again, That God has enjoyned Temperance, as a Duty, ariſes not only from the prime and moſt obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ends of our Being, but from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Self-preſervation, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Methods of Subſiſtence; ſo that allowing the clear Dictates of Reaſon, in the Mind of our great Creator, to be a Rule of Duty, a ſingle Inference will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate Temperance to be a Duty. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, as to thoſe Laws which concern the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:135106:74"/>Perſon of our Neighbours; ſuch I mean as prohibit Murder, or other Violations of their Perſons, it's viſible, the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the Methods of our Subſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whereby we are neceſſitated to rely on the Succours of our Fellow-creatures, will inſtruct us that God did not allow us to aſſaſſinate and deſtroy 'em; the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Suggeſtions of Self-preſervation will oblige us to make the Concluſion. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, the Conſideration of being Fellow-creatures, and a peculiar of a Sovereign Creator, and as ſuch under his immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Conduct and Diſpoſal, will inſtruct us, that we have no right to their Lives, without a ſpecial Commiſſion from him.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, The early Diſcoveries which we find in ourſelves, of Love, Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Compaſſion, and the Earnings which are implanted towards our own Fleſh and Blood, will direct us that God intended we ſhould place a certain Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of theſe native Paſſions and Propenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on thoſe that are deſcended from us, or are compounded of the ſame Ingredients, and formed in the ſame Mould; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently he could never authorize us to commit Violence or Cruelties on their Perſons; ſo abſurd is the Hypotheſis of the <hi>Leviathan,</hi> that projects a State of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:135106:74"/>to be an abſolute State of War. But to proceed to the laſt Inſtance, that of outward Goods and Poſſeſſions, which engages the principal Laws and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Juſtice. Thus to Steal, is, no doubt, a Violation of natural Juſtice, and conſequently a Violation of a Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but yet this reſts on the Force and Authority of a Law antecedent to it, I mean that of Property; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it implies ſeveral Concluſions or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, before we diſcover the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or Obligation of it. Thus to detain or invade a Neighbour's Property, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Compact, is certainly an Act of Violence done to a Law of Nature; but yet it demands a Proof of the Obligations of Compact or voluntary Promiſes, as well as of the Authority of Property, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law can be decyphered. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denyed but theſe are Laws of Nature, becauſe natural Reaſon, by cloſe Reſearches and regular Concluſions, may diſcover their Obligations. I'm ſure it can be no Objection, that they reſult from voluntary Intercourſes and Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions among Mankind, I mean Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacts or Bargains; for the Neceſſities of Nature, dictating ſuch Tranſactions, is a ſufficient Indication of their Divine
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:135106:75"/>Authority and Obligation; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, whatever immediately Reſults from 'em, muſt obtain the ſame Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Obligation, as well as Charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: But yet, it's manifeſt, when Laws of Nature are to be ſupported by a Train of Conſequences, the Evidence is not ſo direct and convincing; becauſe in theſe Caſes the Mind is more fatally expoſed to Miſcarriages. Upon the whole then it appears, that Laws of Nature reſt upon very different Degrees of Evidence. And now thus much being agreed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, it may by theſe Meaſures be more exactly diſcerned which are to be eſteemed Laws of Nature, and which not ſo; which Fundamental, or <hi>de primo Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctamine Naturae,</hi> and which not ſo; and conſequently, the Neceſſity of forming a compleat Scheme of Laws of Nature, ſeems to be wholly ſuperſeeded.</p>

                  <p>§. 1. HAving aſſerted the Authority of Laws of Nature, by fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in the Author of Nature, it natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally directs me to enquire into the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal and Foundation of thoſe Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons we owe to God, or how we are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the Obſervance of his Laws. But before I proceed to a direct Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Matter, I ſhall make ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to what I find in a late excellent Diſcourſe, concerning the Power and Right of Obliging, and particularly as applied to God. He labours to prove that the Right and Power of Obliging is the ſame, eſpecially with reſpect to God; and therefore after a great many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments concludes, <hi>From all which it follows that whereever there is a Right of Obliging, and where there is an abſolute uncontroul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Power of Obliging, there is for that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:135106:76"/>reaſon a Right alſo,</hi> [See <hi>The Certainty and Neceſſity of Religion in general,</hi> Page 100.] Whether theſe Aſſertions are true or no will appear by and by.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I cannot but Premiſe, that Right and Power happening to accompany each other in the Exerciſe of 'em, no more than Heat and Light in the Sun, is no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that they are not two diſtinct things, conceived under two diſtinct Ideas or No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Tho' a Right and Power of Obliging, are both eternally inveſted in God, yet it's no more an Argument that they imply the ſame thing, than that the Attributes of Infinite Power and Juſtice are the ſame. Nay, further, tho' a Right of Obliging may by a Train of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences follow from a Power of Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, or on the contrary, a Power of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliging from a Right of Obliging; yet it's no more an Argument of their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentity, than that a rational Soul and Thought are the ſame, becauſe a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Soul implies a Power of Thinking. And, therefore, tho' an abſolute uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable Power may infer a Right of Obliging, ſo that for that very Reaſon there may be a Right of Obliging, yet they may be as diſtinct as Power and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:135106:76"/>Truth. But to conſider both in their received and eſtabliſhed Ideas or Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Now certainly, were we to appeal not only to the beſt Moraliſts, but to the common Senſe of Mankind, they would unanimouſly concur in two different De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions. And I'm perſwaded they differ as much as a Raparee or Tyrant, from a lawful Prince; as much as doing a thing Rightfully, or upon a juſt Authority, and doing a thing by Violence. For Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence argues a Power of Puniſhing, as well as a rightful Execution of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; both indeed attain the ſame end, that is, engage an Obedience, but upon different Meaſures and Principles. A Power of Obliging, in the ſtrict Notion of it, is only concerned for ſecuring an Obedience, without conſidering the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice or Injuſtice of the Action; but a Right of Obliging implies an Obedience eſtabliſhed on a juſt Authority or Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; if there be any ſuch thing as Juſtice diſtinct from Power.</p>
                  <p>In a word, A Right of Obliging im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the Title of a Superior to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and conſequently, a Title to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force it by ſuitable Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but a Power of Obliging neither implies a Title to the one nor other.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:135106:77"/>Thus an Uſurper may have as abſolute a Command of Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to oblige or ſecure an Obedience, as the moſt rightful Sovereign; yet he certainly wants an Authority to enforce an Obedience, by the Weight and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of Puniſhment; and if he doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force it, he exerciſes Power, but not Right.</p>
                  <p>Again, A rightful Sovereign may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a Title to an Obedience, and to the Exerciſe of Rewards and Puniſhments to enforce it, but he may want a Power to exert his Right, as in the Caſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion or general Defection. The No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is clear and indiſputable, when ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the civil Power on Earth, and it carries the ſame Evidence and Force in it, when applied to the abſolute in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Power of Heaven: For tho' Power and Right, by reaſon of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Perfections of the Divine Nature, are Inſeparable in God, and in Man not ſo; yet the Ideas, or Notions of Right and Power, whether in God or Men, are formed upon the ſame Meaſures and Principles; yea, as much as the Notions of Juſtice, Reaſon, or Purity, allowing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity and Perfection in God, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be given to Men.</p>

Having thus far aſſerted the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of <hi>a Right of Obliging from a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Obliging,</hi> I ſhall proceed a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and conſider whether the Right of Obliging, as a true and proper Law-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, conſiſts in nothing elſe but in a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of contributing to our Happineſs or Miſery, by ſpecial Rewards or Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Thus much ſeems to be aſſerted in the Diſcourſe already cited; for we are told, That <hi>no one has a Right or Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Obliging another to act ſuch a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Way he preſcribes, any further than he has a Power of contributing to the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Miſery of that Being he ſo Preſcribes to, — and that God can no otherwiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an Obligation upon Men to Obey him, than by making 'em know that he has it in his Power, to render them Happy or Miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> Page 95.</p>
                  <p>But certainly, that a Right of Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, as a Law-giver, does not conſiſt in a Power of Rewarding and Puniſhing, is evident from uncontroulable Arguments.</p>
                  <p>As firſt, It cannot be denied but an Equal, that can challenge no Right of Dominion over us, may, upon ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Circumſtances, be inveſted with ſuch a Power of Rewarding and Puniſhing, as
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:135106:78"/>to engage us to Purſue and Imbrace what he dictates to us; and yet ſuch a Power does not give him any Right of Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over us, or induce an Obligation of obeying him as a proper Superiour. A Friend may propoſe Rewards to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine us to any particular Way in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Counſel or Intereſt, and yet not induce a binding Authority upon us, like that of a Law. A Friend or Neighbour may, by Rewards or Favours, be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to contribute ſo highly to our Happineſs, as to induce not only Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of Gratitude, but the Exerciſe of other ſocial Vertues, and yet they do not eſtabliſh a Right of Sovereign Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity upon us.</p>
                  <p>In a word, A Robber, Uſurper, Aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin, or the Devil himſelf may have it in his Power to inflict ſuch Puniſhments as will determine any Man to Act as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes, and yet this Power gives no Right or Title to our Obedience, no more than a Right to inflict thoſe Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that will enforce it. It will eaſily be granted, that a Power of Puniſhing or Rewarding, and conſequently of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing to our Happineſs or Miſery, are the only proper Motives of a rational Obedience, but I cannot conceive how
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:135106:78"/>they can be the Ground of Obedience that is due to a Superior. For nothing can be the Ground of Obedience, but ſuch a Dependence as entitles a Being to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe things upon us by way of Precept or Command, and authoriſes him to inflict Puniſhments when his Commands are not fufilled or executed, ſo that the Ground or Obligation of Obedience, due to Laws, is antecedent to a Power of Rewarding or Puniſhing; ſince it muſt not give Right to a Power of impoſing Precepts or Commands; but to a Power of inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Puniſhments. Indeed the Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages of this Notion, ſeem to ariſe by not diſtinguiſhing the Ground of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, from its proper Motives. I will eaſily grant, that few would be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to yield an Obedience to Commands, that are diſagreeable to any thing about 'em, were there no Power of contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to their Happineſs or Miſery, by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards or Puniſhments; and therefore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can more effectually engage an actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Obedience, with the Diſſolute and Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious, than a Power of contributing to their Happineſs or Miſery, by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards or Puniſhments; but I cannot think that a bare Power of diſpenſing Rewards or Puniſhments, can repreſent
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:135106:79"/>the Right of Obedience, or in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of this Author, <hi>the Right of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliging another;</hi> no more than the Right of Diſpenſing thoſe Rewards or Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we have in our Power. This is an Aſſertion that carries ſo much Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in it, that it holds every way: For were any Subject placed in ſuch Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, that neither Rewards nor Puniſhments were left to oblige him to yield an Obedience, yet he may for all this, acknowledge his Superior's Right to his Obedience. Thus in the Caſe of a general Defection, tho' the Rightful So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign is diveſted of a Power of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding and Puniſhing, the Rebels en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying an abſolute Poſſeſſion of both; yet their Ambition, Revenge, or Succeſs may not carry 'em to ſuch a pitch of Inſolence, but they may ſtill be forced ſecretly to own their Sovereign's Right to their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, as well as Right to that Power of diſpenſing Rewards and Puniſhments, which they have wreſted from him, and particularly a Right of Puniſhment due to their unnatural Defection.</p>
                  <p>Again, I queſtion not but the very De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils in Hell, tho' they know and feel the irreverſible Sentence paſſed againſt 'em, and conſequently have no Motive left
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:135106:79"/>to ingage their Obedience, are forced to recognize their Fealty, or acknowledge God's Right of Dominion over them, in obliging 'em to ſerve and obey him; and his Right in paſſing that very Sentence they actually ſuffer for not obeying him. For in this Senſe they certainly <hi>believe and tremble,</hi> inſomuch that their very Belief ſeems to be an Inſtrument to enhance their Miſery.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this Argument, I can freely grant, that there cannot be a Right of Obliging without a Right of Rewarding or Puniſhing, becauſe (as has already been obſerved) the Right of Rewarding or Puniſhing is founded in a Right of Obliging; but there may be a Power of Rewarding and Puniſhing, without a Right of Rewarding, much leſs of Obliging. In one word, the recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſing a Right of Obliging, or a Title to Obedience, is only an Aſſent of the Mind to a particular Truth; and tho' the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Rewarding or Puniſhing are the only proper Arguments to ſecure an Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, yet I hope there may be other Reaſons or Arguments to engage this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent beſides the Power of Rewarding or Puniſhing, or of contributing to our Happineſs.</p>

                  <p>§. 3. Having thus offered my Reaſons why I Diſſent from this Author, before I determine wherein the Right of Obliging conſiſts, I ſhall offer ſomething againſt Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>'s Notion. He, indeed, carries the thing ſomwhat higher, for he perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptorily affirms, That the Right of God's Sovereign Authority over Mankind, reſts merely upon his irreſiſtible Power; <hi>a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la potentia irreſiſtibili,</hi> De Cive, <hi>cap.</hi> 14, 15. And to confirm the Notion, he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affirms, That one Man might have challenged a Right over the whole Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of Mankind, had he been endued with a Sufficiency of Power to have reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted the united Force of his Fellow-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or, at leaſt, protected them and himſelf. <hi>Manſiſſet igitur ipſi jus dominii in caeteros omnes propter potentiae</hi> exceſſum <hi>qua &amp; ſe &amp; illos conſervare potuiſſet.</hi> Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuant to this, he tells us §. 7. That our Obligations of Obedience are founded in our native Impotence and Fear, <hi>a metu ſive Imbecillitatis propriae (reſpectu Divinae potentia) conſcientiae.</hi> I muſt confeſs, there ſeems to be a near Affinity between this and the Notion already excepted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, tho' this ſeems to be carried much further, and more palpably beyond the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:135106:80"/>Mark. For that admits a Power of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding, as well as Puniſhing, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently includes an Obedience mixed with Love as well as Fear; but this fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es all upon the Power of Puniſhing, and conſequently places all upon Fear, or ſome Glympſes of Hope, without any founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Love. Indeed this is a Notion which deſerves rather Contempt and Scorn than a formal Reply. For it levels us with the unthinking Brutes that periſh, by making Fear, and that too the moſt ſervile part of it, a fear of Puniſhment, the only Spring of Human Actions. This, we ſee, is the Sovereign Principle of his Religion, as well as Politicks, but it has been more than once learnedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed, as concerned in the latter; and it's ſo abſur'd as applyed to the former, that it ſcarce deſerves the leaſt Notice, much leſs a Confutation. I ſhall therefore diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs this Notion with a few Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It's obſervable, that the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments brought to ſupport it, are directed to prove the proper Motive of our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; not God's Right and Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to it; or, in other terms, to enforce an Obedience, not to repreſent the Right or Duty of Obedience.</p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:135106:81"/>
                  <p>Secondly, It is obſervable, that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments ſuggeſted againſt the laſt Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, muſt carry an equal Force againſt this. But, in a word, I think no conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Perſon can diſcern any Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence between a bare Power of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Sett of Men, and a Right of impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Laws and demanding Obedience to 'em; and if 'tis falſe in a finite Power, it muſt be ſo in infinite; for there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference beſides original and delegated, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and limited, neither of which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the nature of Things, Notions or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences; ſo that infinite Power in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing as ſuch, or, as it barely implies, an infinite Power or Ability to puniſh, no more gives the Idea or Denomination of a Right of puniſhing (much leſs a Right of impoſing Laws) than a finite delegated Power doth.</p>

               <div n="4" type="section">
                  <p>§. 4. It remains, that I endeavour to repreſent, wherein the preciſe Nature of a rightful Dominion, Obligation, or Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, with reſpect to God and his Laws, conſiſts. And I ſhall enlarge ſomething more freely upon it, becauſe all delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Right of Dominion and Obedience en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely depends upon it. Thus if we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe civil Government founded in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:135106:81"/>the Right of Dominion and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence muſt reſt upon the Authority of Compacts, as 'tis a Law of Nature, and an indiſpenſable Duty to Obſerve and keep 'em; but the obſervance of 'em cannot be an indiſpenſable Duty, but by ſome Right and Authority, lodged in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Nature, that pronounces 'em ſuch. Thus if civil Government takes its Riſe from a Paternal Right, Conqueſt, Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial Preſcription, or Poſſeſſion, the Right of Dominion or Obedience inveſted in the civil Power, muſt reſt on the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of ſome Divine Law, either na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or revealed, ratifying or confirming their Claims or Titles; and the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this Law muſt reſt on ſome Right which God challenges to impoſe ſuch a Law; ſo that the Authority of every ſort of rightful earthly Power is founded in a Divine Right, in vertue of which, it is ſtiled <hi>the Ordinance of God;</hi> ſince all their Right of Dominion, or Authority, derives from a Supereminent Right in God. Now this is an abſolute Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Abſurdity of the <hi>Hobbiſts</hi> Notion, that Matters of Religion receive their Obligation from the State or civil Power, and conſequently induce an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Obedience: This puts an eternal
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:135106:82"/>Silence to the Diſpute, Whether we are to yield an Obedience to the Laws of the State before the Laws of God, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Laws of the State are to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the Laws of God? For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, ſince God is the Fountain of all Power and Authority, the Duties of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion are ultimately determined by God, as well as receive their Obligation from God; ſo that the civil Power, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives all Authority from God, can only exert a Power in matters of Religion, where God has not interpoſed, or placed it in other hands; but it's the greateſt Abſurdity in Nature to pretend a ſupere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Power to that of God, when the whole any Man can pretend to immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately derives from God.</p>
                  <p>But to return: Firſt then, the true O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal of God's Right of Dominion, or Right of Obliging us, undoubtedly reſults from his creative and preſerving Power. That that Being, which by an abſolute independent Power gives Being to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, has a Right to give Laws, or fix the Meaſures and Rules of his Being, ſeems to be a Maxim that carries a kind of Self-evidence in it; I'm ſure it's the very Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument advanced in the Sacred <hi>Canon, Rom.</hi> 9.20, 21. <hi>Nay, but O Man, who
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:135106:82"/>art thou that repliest against God? ſhall the thing formed ſay to him that formed it, why hast thou made me thus? Hath not the Potter power over the Clay, of the ſame lump to make one Veſſel unto Honor, and another unto Diſhonor?</hi> It's well known, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Argument is to repreſent a ſupereminent Right in God, even ſuch as might juſtly authoriſe him to aſſign thoſe Allotments to Mankind, which his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Goodneſs would never ſuffer him to execute, and conſequently it muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate a Right of giving Laws to thoſe Creatures to whom he gave a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But to purſue the Argument upon the Reaſons of it, It's on all Hands allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that a Right of Dominion is founded in Property, and the more abſolute the Property is, the more unqueſtionable is the Right of Dominion. That Property is the Foundation of Obedience, or a Right of Obliging, both in reſpect of God and Men, this Author freely owns in another place, <hi>pag.</hi> 126. And yet he labours to wave it in the place before us, as will appear more fully by and by. His Conceſſions are theſe, <hi>All the Reaſons and Grounds of our Obedience to Men, and of their Right of Obliging us, are Power, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Property— But God has all theſe
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:135106:83"/>Titles to our Obedience in the highest degree poſſible, for by giving us our entire Being, and every thing that belongs to our Nature, 'tis plain, that he has a greater Property in us by this Act of Creation or Production, than can accrue to any Man by Conqueſt, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, Covenant, or any other way whereby Men come to have a Propriety in one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> I think the Argument is carried ſo full and clear, that it ſeems not capable of an Improvement. It's certain there is no Property ſo abſolute as that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults from a creative preſerving Power. For Creation makes the Property abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, independent and unborrowed; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Spring and Movement, every Power or Faculty, every Intereſt or Happineſs, either actually poſſeſs'd, or capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enjoy'd, is an abſolute Property of a Creator; for all that is within or without us when he firſt ſet us forth into the World, was originally wrapped up, and in time iſſued forth of his infinite Power and Wiſdom; the whole Stock of Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials came out from him, and when 'tis all returned back, he has <hi>but his own.</hi> And <hi>is it not lawful to do what one will with his own?</hi> Subordinate Proprietors indeed may be limited, as to the exerciſe, or uſe of what they have a Propriety in, but
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:135106:83"/>an abſolute independent Proprietor is to account to no one. We may therefore, in the Language of our Saviour, expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulate, <hi>who ſhall give unto him that which is</hi> thus <hi>his own?</hi> Luke 16.12. Again, a preſerving Power, eſpecially ſuch as is peculiar to God, ſeems to advance, or at leaſt corroborate the Propriety he chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges in us. As our Beings took their riſe from another, and were formed by the Hands of an Almighty Creator, we are by a neceſſity of Nature, or the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Frame and Condition of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Beings perpetually dependent, ſo that Reaſon, as well as Revelation, inſtructs us, that <hi>in him we live, move, and have our Beings.</hi> He did not form and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeak us into Being, and after the finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Stroke, put us wholly out of his Hands with an intrinſick Power of Self-ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence; but the ſame Power concurs to continue our Beings, that was required to form us into Being, for every Breath of Life, even our very Soul, and that Reaſon which ſeems to give us Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to act for ourſelves, nay, the whole Cargo of Happineſs, and every Span and Minute of it, perpetually hangs on the preſerving Power of a mighty Creator. So that we may Expoſtulate in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:135106:84"/>of an Apoſtle, <hi>What hast thou that thou didst not receive?</hi> 1 Cor. 4.7. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially ſince we have received nothing but what carries appearance of having not received it, in as much as it ſtill reſts on the preſerving Power of the Donor. Now what can eſtabliſh a Right of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, or a Right of Obliging, if a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty ſo abſolute, ſo independent, ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable, and ſo peculiar as this will not do it? Not only the uncontroverted No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Mankind, but the firſt Workings of Reaſon will ſubſcribe to it. Can Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon diſown that Right by which it moves, and acts, and ſubſiſts? Nay, to advance a little further, this Gentleman, in another place, ingenuouſly confeſſes, that there are certain natural Propenſions or Diſpoſitions in the Soul, that cloſe in with particular Actions, before Reaſon can well exert it ſelf, <hi>p.</hi> 122. And certainly the preſent Notion of a Right of Dominion, founded in a creative, preſerving Power, will be immediately embraced by the ſame ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Propenſions; for I'm perſwaded, could the Mind feel the Idea of ſuch a Power upon her in an Inſtant, there would ſuch an inward Impulſe, like a natural Inſtinct, ariſe, that muſt diſcover a tacit <hi>tremendous</hi> kind of Aſſent to a
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:135106:84"/>Right of Fealty and Allegiance, before Reaſon could draw forth into a ſhread of Arguments to induce it. Indeed, the Title to a Right of Dominion is ſo indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputable, that Reaſon cannot ſuggeſt any thing that can pretend to limit the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of it, beſides God's own immenſe and unchangable Attributes and Perfections. And therefore, tho' I will not diſpute the Power of God, whether he could give his Creatures ſuch Laws as muſt make 'em eternally miſerable, (for did his Power extend thus far, his infinite Wiſdom, Purity and Goodneſs, muſt ſuſpend the exerciſe of it) otherwiſe if theſe could admit of it, I can ſee nothing that we can have recourſe to, either as our own, or from others, that could give Right or Foundation to diſpute the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of 'em. The Nature and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of 'em, might very well obſtruct the Obſervance of 'em; but ſtill there would be no real Foundation, excluſive of the Goodneſs and Purity of God, to cancel the Authority of 'em. However theſe may be Niceties, and therefore it's by no means material to adjuſt or ſettle 'em. It's abundantly ſufficient, that a creative, preſerving Power, is an ample Foundation to eſtabliſh a Right of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:135106:85"/>and Obligations of Obedience, with reſpect to thoſe Laws which God at any time has enjoyned us, or his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Purity, Goodneſs, or Wiſdom ſhall ſuffer him to enjoyn us. For as long as his bleſſed Attributes and Perfections re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate the divine Decrees, there can be no Laws impoſed, but what directly tend to the Happineſs and welfare of his Creatures.</p>

               <div n="5" type="section">
                  <p>§. 5. But further, we may conſider the creative Power of God, as in reality it is, an incomparable Bleſſing or Benefit. For we cannot imagin, but an act of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation was an effect of infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs as well as Power. I'm ſure the diſtinguiſhing Marks of Favour God has placed on Man, beyond the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of the Creation, in ſtamping him with his own Image, and framing him for a Life and Action like himſelf, abundantly demonſtrate that infinite Goodneſs, conſpired with infinite Power, in his firſt Production. It cannot then be denied, but a Fund of Benefits was raiſed in the firſt Principles of his Being: And certainly the firſt Notices of Reaſon inſtruct us, that Benefits imply an Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to Duty, and a Right in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:135106:85"/>to challenge it; and therefore unleſs God, after he had given us a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, had done any thing to cancel that Intereſt which the Bleſſings of our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion gave him in us, he has a Right to our Obedience, without the addition of new Favours or Rewards; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a Power of contributing further to our Happineſs, by diſpenſing freſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, cannot be required to eſtabliſh a Right of Obliging. But I muſt freely confeſs, that the receipt of Benefits only induces an Obligation to make ſuitable Returns for what is received; when this is done, the Obligation ceaſes, and conſequently it cannot infer ſuch gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Obligations of Obedience as are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in a legiſlative Power, or a Power of impoſing Laws. It's true, where there is a continued Succeſſion of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, and where the very Laws 'emſelves bring in new Benefits, it muſt needs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate our Obligations, and render 'em as univerſal as thoſe that ariſe from a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative Power. And this being the true Caſe between God and us, I mean in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his Laws, a Right of Duty and Obedience may be founded in that Fund of Benefits he has heaped on us. But yet this is a further Demonſtration, that the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:135106:86"/>true and fundamental Right of Dominion and Obedience flows from God's creative Power, whereby he hath made us, and not we ourſelves. And that this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Benefits, and all others, concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with, if not derive from it. In a word, this eſtabliſheth ſuch an unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable Right of Dominion and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that were there no other to ſupport it, it's alone ſufficient to give the great Creator of the World a Right to Govern Mankind by Laws, and enforce the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of 'em by ſuitable Rewards and Puniſhments.</p>

It now remains, that I conſider what is ſaid by this Author, in Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God's Right of Sovereignty from his creative Power: His Words are theſe, <hi>It is not his great and ſupereminent Power in creating Men, and giving them Being, which is ſolely in itſelf the Ground and Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Title to their Obedience.</hi> His Argument is, — <hi>For was Miſery the certain unalterable Condition of their Being without End or Decreaſe, how could the Author of their Being be imagined to oblige 'em to obey his Commands?</hi> Now before I give a direct Anſwer, I cannot but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark that it ſeems to be diſingenuous or
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:135106:86"/>unfair to argue upon important Matters, by Suppoſitions that contradict the thing in Fact, that never were in Fact, and that involve a Complication of Abſurdities that they ever ſhould be ſo; ſuch I take to be the Creation of Man to an unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble State of Miſery without a Poſſibility of an End or Decreaſe; for this Way of arguing often ſerves to confound rather than illuſtrate or diſcover Truth. But 2dly, An Inſtance ought to have been aſſigned againſt the binding Authority of a creative Power, that implies a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in God of contributing to our Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Miſery; otherwiſe it concludes nothing againſt a creative Power as 'tis now eſtabliſhed, no more than it advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces his own Hypotheſis. But if Man is created to an infinite and irreverſible State of Miſery, then God has no longer a Power in this Caſe of contributing to his Happineſs or Miſery, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can be no Argument againſt a Right of Dominion founded in a creative Power, that admits of infinite Rewards as well as Puniſhments. 3dly, The Inſtance gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſeems to diſcard Man from being the proper Subject of a Law: For 'tis in vain to give Laws to a Being that is irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſible and infinitely happy or miſerable,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:135106:87"/>ſince Laws in this Caſe can turn to no manner of End or Improvement; we may as well ſuppoſe a Man infinitely, and irreverſibly happy, and this implies infinite Perfection, I mean as much as a finite Nature is capable of, and then God will not only be diſabled from adding to his Happineſs by new Rewards, but new Laws. 4thly. The Force of this Inſtance only extends to determine the Motives, not the Right of Obedience; or, in a word, what will engage us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to obey, not wherein the Right or Duty of Obedience is fixed; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tho' Rewards and Puniſhments are the true and proper Motives to ſecure a rational Obedience, yet the Right of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience may reſt upon a diſtinct Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. Now I have a Preſident before me, I may at leaſt with leave of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſuppoſe ſomething out of the Way as well as he, to prove the truth of the Aſſertion; ſuppoſe a Man created to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and irreverſible Happineſs, though God has no longer a Power of contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or adding to his Happineſs, yet I hope this Author in this Caſe will not deny God's Right of Sovereignty, and Dominion over him, as his Creature. In one word, I have proved, That the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:135106:87"/>Devils in Hell are or will be in a State of irreverſible and infinite Miſery, and though for this Reaſon they can be acted with no Inclinations of Obedience, yet they muſt ſtill believe, or acknowledge the Sovereignty of their Creator, and tremble.</p>
                  <p>I preſume I have now in ſome Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure fixed the Foundation of God's Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty and Dominion over us; and tho' I have uſed ſome Liberty in rejecting the Opinions of others, yet I hope I may fairly account for it. For the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I have contended for, are founded on things, that fall in with the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sentiments of Mankind; ſuch as are properly founded in a creative preſerving Power, and conſequently they muſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a Submiſſion, and Obedience upon the cleareſt Convictions of Reaſon; and as long as the Arguments ſuggeſted are cogent and ſatisfactory, it is not Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to leave the common Road, and put things of Moment and Importance upon an Iſſue that it may be wants Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; or at leaſt contradicts ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Truths or Notions. But now an Enquiry of this Nature has been made, I cannot diſmiſs the Argument without adoring our Great and Good God, Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:135106:88"/>and Sovereign, <hi>For who is like unto the Lord our God, who dwelleth on High, and yet humbleth Himſelf to behold the things that are in Heaven and in the Earth,</hi> Pſalm 113. <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6. Tho' God is inveſted with ſuch an abſolute Sovereignty over the Sons of Men, yet he has graciouſly condeſcended to conſider their Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Wants and Neceſſities. It's alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy concluded, that the Laws he original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gave to Mankind are adapted to the great Ends and Intereſts of our Nature; they are not only contrived to preſerve its Frame from Violence and Ruin, but to advance and ſecure that Happineſs its capable of receiving: They are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived not ſo much to repreſent the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of an abſolute Creator, as to eſtabliſh the Happineſs of his Creatures; whatever Right of Dominion God may challenge to impoſe thoſe Laws he has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us, it's manifeſt they carry their own Arguments of Obedience along with 'em. He has not bound us with the Cords of Fear, but Love; indeed they have the higheſt Overtures of Love to recommend 'em; Love not only for the exceeding Recompence of Reward that is annexed to the obſervance of 'em, but Love that is contained in the very
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:135106:88"/>Frame of 'em, even Love as dear and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable to us, as the Love of Ourſelves, and our own Happineſs, ſince they are the direct and immediate Inſtruments of Happineſs; ſo that were God deſtitute of a Right of impoſing Laws, or even a Power of contributing further to our Happineſs by freſh Rewards, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Tendency of thoſe Laws he has actually impoſed (if not obſtructed by very debauched Propenſions,) is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ſecure an Obedience to him.</p>

                  <p>§. 1. INdeed I have already touched upon this Argument, in the Diſquiſition of a Law of Nature; but in order to the eſtabliſhing a Scheme of Natural Religion, I think myſelf obliged to enlarge a little further up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. And firſt, I ſhall not Appeal to the Argument of Natural Conſcience, warranted by Revelation itſelf; in as much as it contains an Abſolving or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning Faculty in it, and conſequently muſt be acted with a Senſe of Rewards and Puniſhments, the immediate Spring or Appendage of ſuch Powers or Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. This will be conſidered on another Subject. To proceed then, It's already concluded, That the Dictates of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reaſon are true and proper Laws e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed in a rightful and competent Authority; that is, in one word, they
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:135106:89"/>are the Commands of a Sovereign Power and Authority over the whole Off-ſpring of Mankind. And 'tis already conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that Rewards and Puniſhments (I mean ſuch as are lodged in the Hands of the Legiſlator, not the natural Effects of the Action, ariſing from the Obſervation or Violation of the Law) are, at leaſt, the neceſſary Appendages or Concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of a Law. I will not run into the nice and tedious Diſputes of the Schools, and examine whether Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments are ſo much of the Nature or Eſſence of a Law, that it loſes the deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of a Law without them: This muſt be allowed by thoſe, that place the Obligation of a Law purely in a Power of Rewarding or Puniſhing. But this has been diſputed already, and therefore I'm inclined to the Negative. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it cannot be denied, but Rewards are an inſeparable Property of a Law, adding Perfection to it, and a Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive peculiar to every Legiſlator. For certainly no one can be a rightful Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, without a Right to deſpenſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Puniſhments: They declare and ſignifie a binding Authority, and no one can paſs for a rightful Legiſlator, without a Right to oblige or require Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:135106:90"/>Herein a Law diſtinguiſhes it ſelf from Counſel or Exhortation. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, they contribute to the Perfection of a Law, ſince the Ends and Intentions of it cannot be ſecured without 'em.</p>
                  <p>This is abſolutely neceſſary, where the Perſons that yield an Obedience, are acted by contrary Diſpoſitions and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſions; and conſequently they may juſtly be eſteemed inſeparable Properties of a Law. I will not diſpute the Power or Prerogative of Heaven, whether God could not rightfully enjoyn a Law with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out annexing ſuitable Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments; but whoſoever compares the Laws he has enjoyned with the Propenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Human Nature, will be apt to impeach his infinite Wiſdom for not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexing ſuitable Rewards as well as Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, ſince without 'em it's moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impoſſible to enforce the Obſervance of ſuch Laws. Indeed Rewards and Puniſhments are ſo much a Property of a Law, that God thought fit to uſher the firſt poſitive Law he gave to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind into the World, by annexing 'em to it; <hi>In the Day that thou eatest there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of thou ſhalt ſurely die,</hi> Gen. 2.17. As if he intended to imprint a Senſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Puniſhments in the Original
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:135106:90"/>Idea of a Law. In a word, they are ſo much the Property of a Law, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there is the Face of Government, and Laws enacted, Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments are eſteemed the unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Prerogatives of the legiſlative Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. The whole Off-ſpring of Mankind that were ever under the Conduct of a Law, are acted with ſuch a deep Senſe of 'em, that a Right of Puniſhment is never diſputed, tho' the Penalty is not expreſly annexed. Thus far then at leaſt we are advanced; unleſs we can deny a Sovereign Creator a Right of exerciſing a legiſlative Power, we muſt allow him a Right of executing Puniſhments upon the Violation of his Laws, as well as a Power of rewarding the Obſervance of them.</p>

               <div n="2" type="section">
                  <p>§. 2. But now the Certainty of Divine Puniſhments, as well as Rewards, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing all his Laws, even Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is evinced from indiſputable Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities. Few will be forward to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the Certainty of Rewards, and therefore I ſhall conſider it purely with reſpect to Puniſhments: And 1st, That God will diſpence certain Puniſhments
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:135106:91"/>upon the Violation of any Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, follows from the general Ends and Intentions of all Law-givers; eſpecially the Supreme Divine Law-giver, that gave Being to every Soul, that is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of receiving a Law, as well as Laws to govern them by. Now no Law-giver can ever give Laws to others, without deſigning, for ſome ſpecial Ends and Purpoſes, to have them executed, and obſerved: Without this it's abſurd, for a Law-giver to engage in enacting Laws, or trouble his Subjects with the Burden that ariſes from the Impoſition of them. In a word, it's to act in vain, or to no purpoſe; an Imputation that cannot without Horror, and Blaſphemy be charged upon God, who is always go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the unchangeable Dictate of infinite Wiſdom. Therefore ſince we muſt conclude, that the Sovereign Lord of all the World, is acted with the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt concern to have his Laws executed, ſince Puniſhment is the beſt Expedient to enforce the Execution of 'em, and ſince Puniſhment is due upon the Violation of 'em, it muſt follow that Puniſhment will attend the Violation of 'em.</p>

                  <p>§. 3. But 2dly, The Certainty of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment diſcovers itſelf from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of theſe Laws, with relation to thoſe Beings to whom they are given. Now it's already concluded, That Laws of Nature ariſe from the eſtabliſhed Frame and Condition of our Beings, and Concenter with the prime Ends and Intereſts of 'em. The Obſervance of Laws of Nature bring natural Rewards along with 'em, ſufficient to recommend 'em to the Choices of reaſoning Beings; and the Violation of 'em implies a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuntiation, not only of the common Rules of Prudence, but Self-preſervation, the neceſſary Inſtinct of ſenſitive unthink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Beings. And therefore when Laws of Nature are violated, there ſeems no Room or Foundation left to excite or work upon infinite Mercy: Indeed, did God act like an <hi>Egyptian</hi> Task-maſter, and not only require Brick without Straw, but continue the Tail upon the greateſt Sweat and Drudgery, merely to exert an abſolute Sovereignty and Dominion, he might ſometimes be melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Compaſſion, when a poor Vaſſal happens to fall ſhort of the Line of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:135106:92"/>Duty; but now the Violation of them, implies the higheſt Aggravations of Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and reſolved Iniquity; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we cannot imagine that any thing can induce an infinitely wiſe Creator to ſuſpend any Puniſhments he can juſtly execute.</p>

               <div n="4" type="section">
                  <p>§. 4. But 3dly, Let us conſider the Nature of the Command, with reſpect to God that gave them. Now certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſince it is concluded, That Laws of Nature, or Dictates of Nature take their Riſe from the Author of Nature, they are not only eſtabliſhed according to the original Frame of created Nature; but according to the infinite Purity and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of God: They are the expreſs Image of his Perſon, and the Brightneſs of that infinite Mind, with whom there is no Shadow of Darkneſs or Impurity. On this Account the Violation of Laws of Nature, is not only an Affront com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt the Majeſty and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Authority of God; but a groſs Aſperſion upon his infinite Purity and Holineſs; and conſequently it muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage him in the deepeſt Reſentments: So that Puniſhment is now no more an Act
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:135106:92"/>of Sovereignty, but an Act of Juſtice, to wipe off the Dirt that is by this means caſt upon his infinite Purity: If He's of purer Eyes than to behold, much leſs to cohabit with Iniquity, certainly he muſt be armed with the higheſt Reſentments, even ſuch as will anſwer the Character he has given of himſelf, <hi>for our God is a conſuming Fire.</hi> And therefore though his infinite Love and Mercy, might ſometimes engage him to remit the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment that is due to the Violation of a known Law, yet his infinite Juſtice will not ſuffer him, till he has ſatisfied the Demands of his infinite Purity and Holineſs. In one word, whoſoever ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly ſurveys the Actions of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, will plainly diſcover how di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly all his Laws reſult from the whole Circle of his Divine Attributes; and therefore it's a ſenſeleſs Project to ſet up his Mercy againſt his Juſtice, Purity and Goodneſs, and thereupon promiſe our ſelves an Exemption from Puniſhment: It's evident therefore that Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as well as all other Laws are guarded with Puniſhments ſuitable to the Nature of 'em. And if God is not concerned to vindicate his Authority,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:135106:93"/>he'll certainly be concerned to vindicate his infinite Purity and Goodneſs; and therefore we may conclude <hi>tho' Hand joyn in Hand, the Diſobedient ſhall not go unpuniſhed.</hi> I will not pretend to fix a Standard of Puniſhment for Offences committed againſt Laws of Nature, I mean with reſpect to the Nature, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees or Continuance of them; for tho' there are a great many Arguments that might ſuggeſt very conſiderable Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries in theſe matters; yet I think they were in a great meaſure Secrets lodged in the Hands of God, till he thought fit to reveal himſelf in Caſes of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, this being the proper Buſineſs of Revelation: It's ſufficient to Believers and Chriſtians, that he has now done it beyond all diſpute or cavil. Again, I will not pretend to conclude every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Soul that acts againſt Laws of Nature under the Vengeance of Heaven: Puniſhment no doubt will be proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned according to the means of Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and there may be certain Caſes in a State of Nature, where invincible Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance may be a Plea at the Bar of Juſtice to particular Perſons; but yet the Actions of Men are intricate, and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:135106:93"/>Knowledge ſhallow, and of a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row compaſs; and therefore we muſt leave theſe as Secrets to the <hi>Diſcerner of Spirits,</hi> and that <hi>Candle of the Lord,</hi> I mean every Man's particular Conſcience. It's ſufficient that the Violations of Laws of Nature antecedent to Revelation, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Mankind obnoxious to Puniſhments, and that all the Reaſon in the World inſtructs us, God will infallibly inflict them. And therefore it's the Concern of Mankind, either to live in the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of 'em, or to appear with a more ſubſtantial Defence than I can think of, leſt they bring themſelves into an irrever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible State of Condemnation.</p>

Several Attempts of this kind have been made by eminent and learned Hands, ſome with great Succeſs, and to all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable Satisfaction. It's ſufficient if I have in ſome Meaſure prepared a Key that will unlock the Cabinet; and ſo far let us into the Book of Nature, that we may by the Workings of natural Reaſon diſcover the great Lines of Laws of Nature, and judge which are to be ranked into the number, and which eſteemed poſitive. But ſince the whole Hypotheſis is advanced without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to relative Characters, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Original and Obligation of relative Duties are not ſo directly meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:135106:94"/>by it; I ſhall take the Liberty of enquiring into thoſe which God in his Providence has made ſo important in the Affairs of Men, I mean thoſe between Parents and Children. And firſt of a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rental Love and Affection: Indeed this is a Paſſion ſo deeply impreſſed on the Frame of the Soul, that it powerfully diſcovers itſelf thro' all the Parts of the Animal World. To love our own Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, ſeems to be the Effects of a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Inſtinct or Propenſion, that as vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently exerts itſelf, as the Spark that flies upwards. The Moral Vertuoſo's of the preſent Age are here ſhamefully foil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in projecting their Scheme: For tho' they may labour to ſtifle the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of other Laws, that beſpeak them to be the pure Workings of Nature; the Teſtimony which the ſenſitive Order of Creatures bears to this of natural Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, renders their Attempts wholly unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful. It might have been replied, That a parental Affection expreſſed in the Care of their own Off-ſpring, is only a faſhionable Imployment, ſet on foot to perpetuate their own Names and Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; but when the lower Order of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that want Faculties to form any
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:135106:95"/>ſuch foreſighted Projections, diſcover an equal Share of Concern, Induſtry and Compaſſion; they as well as we muſt conclude that it's the Effect of ſome pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Propenſions, wove in with the Frame and Conſtitution of our Beings. Indeed the Fondneſs, Vigilance, Labour and Induſtry, that unthinking Brutes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe towards there own Off-ſpring, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be reſolved into any thing, but a powerful Sympathy and Earning which God hath implanted in them, as they bear their own Image and Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or rather as they are the Effects of their own moſt intimate Powers and Faculties, and carry their own Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Life, Blood, and Spirits in 'em; or, in a word, as they imply the moſt ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Expanſion and Propagation of their own Natures.</p>
                  <p>And here I cannot well forbear a ſhort Digreſſion. If it be enquired how theſe inward Motions are excited, I think it may be ſafely replied, Not by Reaſon, or a formal Inference; for no Inference can be made even from particular Objects, but by the help of abſtract Ideas, or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Notions, or Maxims, and a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of comparing and diſtinguiſhing two
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:135106:95"/>or more things together: Thus, Suppoſe a Lioneſs by Reaſon were to conclude that this, and not another, to wit, a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, third, or fourth Whelp is her own Off-ſpring; ſhe muſt compare the Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring in certain Lineaments and Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or other ſenſible Qualities, with the Idea ſhe had before conceived; ſhe muſt compare this with the Idea ſhe has of thoſe ſhe rejects; and after a ſtrict Agreement with the former, and a pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable Diſagreement with the latter, ſhe cannot come to a rational Aſſent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome abſtracted Ideas of Identity and Diverſity, or without the help of two general Maxims, that where the preſent Object exactly agrees with the Idea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conceived, it is the ſame, and where the preſent Object differs from the Idea, which another particular Object yields, it cannot be the ſame but another. This is the Analyſis of the moſt ſimple Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and of a narrower compaſs too, than ſome of Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s Complex Ideas, and therefore I cannot but wonder how he, upon his Definition of Reaſon, can aſſign Reaſon to Brutes, eſpecially when he denies them a Power of abſtracting, or compounding, or forming Complex I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:135106:96"/>and allows them a Power of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring only in a very inferior Degree. <hi>See</hi> Eſſay B. 2. Cap. 11. <hi>and</hi> B. 4. Cap. 17.</p>
                  <p>But to return, It's viſible theſe inward Motions of Tenderneſs and Compaſſion are excited by the Emanation of certain Particles peculiar to the Off-ſpring of each reſpective Kind or Order of Brutes, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affecting the Senſe of Smelling. And hence the ſilly Brute exerciſes the ſame Fondneſs towards her Siſter's Off-ſpring; nay, even towards one of another Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in caſe the difference in Form, Smell, Shape or Proportion is not too notorious. Hence, we may preſume, the Affection dwindles and wears off, as theſe Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that accompanied the Off-ſpring from the Womb, decay in Power and Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and conſequently that by a Law of Providence they retain 'em, till they are capable of providing for their own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence. From all this it's indiſputably evident, that a parental Affection is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in the very Frame and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Unthinking Brutes. And therefore, ſince Providence has inſtituted the ſame Laws and Methods for bringing Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind into the World, with thoſe he has
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:135106:96"/>aſſign'd to Brutes, we muſt conclude that he has created 'em with the ſame original Propenſions; and as he has given 'em no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler Powers and Faculties, as Springs and Movements to every Action, ſo we muſt conclude that theſe Propenſions in Men are ſet on Work after a different manner from thoſe in Brutes. They are not acted by pure Senſations, but by the Powers of Reaſon added to 'em; for when a Child is repreſented to the Mind to be the moſt lively Exertion of our vital Powers and Faculties, <hi>to be Bone of our Bone, and Fleſh of our Fleſh,</hi> the firſt Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to ſuch an Idea, muſt actuate theſe native Propenſions into all the Offices of Love, Care and Tenderneſs. Theſe are but the natural Sallies of that Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which we were created with towards ourſelves; for <hi>no one as yet ever hated his own Fleſh, but nouriſheth and cheriſheth it.</hi> So that a parental Affection is ſo much a Law of Nature, that the firſt Suggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Reaſon excite to the exerciſe of it. A ſingle Concluſion commands an Aſſent to the Duty, and at the ſame time kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles or actuates the Affections into a Practice ſuitable to it. Indeed it's a Law that ſo apparently reſults from the Frame
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:135106:97"/>of Humane Nature, that it carries the Appearance of being Innate; and, in one word, for Man to love and cheriſh his Off-ſpring, is certainly the Reſult of an innate Propenſion; but the exerciſe of it from the conſideration of the cloſe Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity it bears to his own Fleſh and Blood, is a Work of Reaſon. This ſeems to be a Law truly written in our Hearts, for if we ever think or reaſon upon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, Nature will command a practical Aſſent to it. Indeed Reaſon does not more carefully dictate the Law than Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; both within and without conſpire to enforce the Practice of it; for if the firſt Workings of Reaſon powerfully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite a paternal Affection, I'm ſure the primitive Impotence in which Providence has decreed Mankind to be brought forth, loudly inſtructs us we ſhould exert it in the moſt affectionate Methods of Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                  <p>In a word, A parental Care and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is ſo clearly pointed out as a Duty, even by the Dictates of Natural Reaſon, that the perpetual Reproaches, which the Care and Conduct of ſenſeleſs Brutes throw upon the Neglect of it, are (one would think) Puniſhment or Motive ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:135106:97"/>to enforce the Obſervance of it. And therefore where ſuch natural Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of Compaſſion are wanting, it's an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Indication that the Mind is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperately ſunk in Barbarity. And now let the Latitudinarian endeavour to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn this Branch of a Law of Nature, by trumping up ſome unnatural Cruelties among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> yet I think it reſts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an unſhaken Foundation; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore before he Rejects it upon ſuch a ſlender Suggeſtion, let him conſider that there are ſome few Monſters among Brutes, that inſtead of Preſerving, deſtroy their own Off-ſpring. And as there are ſome among this Order, ſo God may, <hi>to make known the Power of his Name,</hi> ſuffer ſome Monſters among Men, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out injuring a Law, that is eſtabliſhed with ſo much Evidence and Solemnity.</p>

                  <p>§. 2. I proceed in the ſecond place, to conſider the Foundation and Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of filial Reverence and Duty.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, I think a parental Care and Tenderneſs, in fencing us from Cold and Nakedneſs, and giving us a liberal Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, when, without the firſt, we muſt have periſhed in our own Impotence,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:135106:98"/>is ſufficient, if once applied to the Mind, and attended to, to dictate the higheſt Tokens of Reverence, if not Duty. A ſenſe of ſuch ineſtimable Benefits upon the firſt Convictions of Reaſon, are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to induce an Obligation to make ſuitable Returns to 'em, and I think no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than that Honour and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that expreſſes itſelf in a conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Submiſſion to all juſt and equitable Commands. I mean ſuch as paſs for the Conſequences of Laws of Nature, or are fairly conſiſtent with 'em. But this ſeems to carry us no further than the Kindneſs of a ſignal Benefactor indiſpenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably obliges us to; whereas a Parent implies ſomething more conſiderable than the Notion of a Benefactor can ſuggeſt, and therefore Reaſon ſeems to dictate that God hath raiſed a more ſtrict and abſolute Foundation of Obedience; and certainly the Obedience which is paid towards a Parent, is naturally acted with ſuch a reverential Awe and Deference, as argues a kind of Authority and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and conſequently contains ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more in it than a Senſe of Benefits. And truly our great Creator hath ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently diſcovered the thing, ſince he ſeems
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:135106:98"/>to have raiſed an Obedience from the ſame Title, upon which his Right of Obedience is eſtabliſhed; a creating as well as preſerving Power. For ſince he has decreed to make Parents the great Inſtruments of our Production and Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, as well as Preſervation, we muſt conclude, that he intended to eſtabliſh an Obedience upon it. It's abundantly concluded, that as God is, by the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Natural Reaſon, repreſented to us to be the great Fountain of our Being and Preſervation, a Senſe of Duty and Obedience, as well as a Right of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, as powerfully reſults from it, as Light from the Sun.</p>
                  <p>And ſince Parents, by a Divine De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, are honoured with the ſame Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters in as eminent a manner as is conſiſtent with the Nature of a Creature or Subſtitute; and are Created with ſtrong and invincible Propenſions, as well as Laws and Obligations, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Intentions of them, Reaſon will oblige us to conclude, that God has thereby induced Obligations of a ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Obedience, that is, in all thoſe Caſes wherein he has not expreſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed by a Law of Nature, or Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:135106:99"/>Indeed this ſeems to be an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to eſtabliſh and confirm that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Right of Obedience which his creative preſerving Power challenges over us; and in a word, his appointing our Production in a ſtrict Imitation of his Methods of Creation, is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Intentions to eſtabliſh an unqueſtionable Right of Dominion in both Caſes: Since the ſame Motives in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct us to acknowledge a ſupereminent Right of Dominion in our Common Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and a ſubordinate one in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural.</p>

               <div n="3" type="section">
                  <p>§. 3. But further, it's already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, That the Offices of Parental Duty are enforced upon the ſtrongeſt Propenſions, as well as Obligations, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven an invincible Concern for our own Fleſh and Blood; and where the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern is reciprocal, we cannot imagine but it ſerves to eſtabliſh a Right of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Obedience, as well as enforce it. But now as the great Creator of the World thought it neceſſary to repreſent and enforce the Duty of Parents by certain indeleble Propenſions, ſo Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will inſtruct us, that he has conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:135106:99"/>Propenſions as powerful in Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, upon which he intended to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a Senſe of Duty, as well as enforce an Obedience. Indeed where the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are equally binding, of the ſame moment and importance, and an equal Intention to maintain and enforce 'em, we cannot imagine but our wiſe Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver would make the ſame Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to ſee his Deſigns and Intentions an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. And truly the Duties of both turn upon the ſame Foundation, a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate Affection to our own Fleſh and Blood. For the Concern we entertain for it in ourſelves, will naturally convey itſelf to thoſe that are but one remove from us. This is ſo apparent, that it's juſtly to be eſteemed a main Foundation of the common Bowels of Humanity, and thoſe Social Offices we exerciſe as Men towards one another.</p>
                  <p>But to return; It's viſible, the Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is equal on both hands, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently we may juſtly preſume, that the Propenſions of Duty and Reverence are as ſtrong on the Child's part, that receives a Being and Subſiſtence, as the Propenſions of Care and Compaſſion on the Parents that miniſters both.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:135106:100"/>The Maxim holds this way, <hi>no one as yet ever hated his own Fleſh.</hi> From all this it's evident, ſince God has implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch deep and powerful Propenſions, we muſt conclude, that the bare Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of a Parent to the Mind, ſo as to apprehend the true force and purport of the Term, will naturally command theſe Propenſions into the higheſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Duty and Obedience, as well as Awe and Reverence: This is a Duty ſo legible in the Frame and Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Beings, that Nature, by the help of a ſingle Concluſion at the ſame time, dictates and enforces it: And I'm perſwaded, were not the Frame of the Soul, in this as well as other Caſes, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably perverted by vitious Habits, or Diſpoſitions, contracted thro' Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Example, it's impoſſible but ſhe muſt reſt under a perpetual Senſe and Apprehenſion of it.</p>
                  <p>And now let ſome Men Harangue up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Act of Generation as liberally and contemptibly as they pleaſe, we have all the Reaſon in the World to believe, that God has made it one Ground of an eternal and indiſpenſable Duty. I'm ſure he that ſubſcribes to
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:135106:100"/>the Truth and Divinity of the Sacred Oracles, muſt own it as ſuch, ſince we find it expreſly aſſigned as an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Duty: <hi>Hearken unto thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that begat thee,</hi> Prov. 23. ver. 22. But then when we conſider, that we did not only take our Riſe from the Loins of a Parent, but drew all our Bleſſings thro' his Care and Inſpection, and that God, by a ſpecial Decree, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned it upon 'em as an indiſpenſable Duty, it's an evident Confirmation of the fundamental Title, that of Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and an unqueſtionable Argument, that God intended to induce indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Obligations of Obedience upon it. And truly he that conſiders and allows God's Right of Dominion to be founded in his creative preſerving Power, muſt allow a ſubordinate Right of Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in him whom he has made the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Inſtrument and Subſtitute for diſplaying the Glory and Wonders of it.</p>
                  <p>Thus far, I preſume, it's abundantly evident, that the Obligations of Filial Duty and Obedience reſt upon an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable Foundation. That which remains, is to conſider the Extent of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:135106:101"/>'em; and this will beſt be performed by applying 'em to the firſt Parent of Mankind, from whom the Notion will preſent itſelf as it lies in its original Model. And certainly we may, in the firſt place, affirm, That Filial Duty and Obedience doth not barely conſiſt in any external Ceremonies, or Inſtances, of Reſpect, nor even thoſe that termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in Obligations to ſuccour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a Parent under Want or Diſtreſs; but it extends to the Regulation of our Lives and Actions by Commands and Laws in all the Parts and Inſtances of Human Life.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="4" type="section">
                  <p>§. 4. From what has already been offered, I think it may, with force of Reaſon, be affirmed, That the firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of Mankind is, by God, inveſted with a Sovereign Power over his Off-ſpring to preſcribe Laws for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of their Lives and Actions, in all Caſes and Emergencies purſuant to the Laws of God— whether natural or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, or where God has no way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed to the contrary. And purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to this, it's an uncontroverted Truth, that the Patriarchs rightfully exerciſed
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:135106:101"/>the Prieſtly Function, till God interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by a poſitive Inſtitution, and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted a ſtanding Order of Men to <hi>wait on his Altar;</hi> this is ſo agreeable to the Divine Will, that though private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons cannot preſide in the public Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God without an Intruſion of the Prieſtly Office, yet every Parent by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Deſignation and Appointment is ſtill a kind of Prieſt within the Diſtrict of his own Family: And certainly if a Paternal or Patriarchal Power originally includes a Prieſtly Power, I can ſee no Reaſon to diſpute the Authority of a Kingly Power. And agreeable to this, Hiſtory aſſures us, that the Kings of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> as well as other Governments, originally exerciſed a Sacerdotal as well as Civil Juriſdiction.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed: The Buſineſs, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign and Authority of the ſupreme Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or in a word, of all thoſe delegated Powers which God hath or ever will eſtabliſh among Mankind, is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe Laws for the Regulation of our Lives and Actions in all Caſes and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergences. And if Government and poſitive Human Laws— by the Laws of Nature and the Frame of our Beings
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:135106:102"/>are abſolutely neceſſary to the Conduct of Mankind in a State of Nature, as well as Grace; we have all the Reaſon in the World to conclude, that this Power and Authority was originally lodged in the paternal Power of <hi>Adam</hi> over his own Off-ſpring. It's certain, the Prerogatives of the Supreme Power, do not extend to the wreſting away re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Rights and Immunities which the Laws of Nature or Revelation give us; for their original Inſtitution is to advance the Wellfare and Happineſs of Mankind, by ſecuring and enforcing the obſervance of them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſince it is indiſputably concluded, that an authoritative Power is lodged in the Fatherhood, there is no Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the Nature of the Thing, but the Paternal Power of <hi>Adam</hi> might extend to the impoſing ſuch Laws as are fitted to anſwer theſe Ends and Purpoſes. Indeed God's ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Government neceſſary, ſeems to advance his Paternal Power to all the Rights and Prerogatives of it, unleſs he had eſtabliſhed it upon another Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation by ſome expreſs Law; for God having created the Off-ſpring of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:135106:102"/>
                     <hi>Adam</hi> with the ſtrongeſt Propenſions of Obedience to him as a Father, God having eſtabliſhed an Obedience upon the ſame Principles upon which he challenges our Obedience, we muſt conclude, that a Right of Obedience accrews to <hi>Adam</hi> as a Father in all thoſe Caſes wherein God has made it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for Mankind to be governed by Laws: And ſince God has made it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the Off-ſpring of <hi>Adam,</hi> and in them, the Off-ſpring of Mankind (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the higheſt Neceſſity, that of Nature and Exiſtence) to live by Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and to be governed by Laws in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the enforcement of the Laws of God, whether Natural or Revealed, and in them in order to the Security of the Wellfare and Happineſs of Mankind, the Paternal Power of <hi>Adam</hi> muſt ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally extend to all the Prerogatives of delegated Power, ſo that by vertue of his Characters which God brought him into the World under, he's to all Intents and Purpoſes God's immediate Vice-ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, unleſs ſome poſitive and expreſs Law had ſignified the contrary.</p>
                  <p>In a word, a Neceſſity ariſing from the Frame and Order of Nature, is, in
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:135106:103"/>a State of Nature, the proper Evidence for Divine Deſignation and Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or indeed, for any Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and therefore ſince Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is thus far neceſſary, Reaſon will dictate God's Intentions in placing it, that is, according to the Order of Nature, or where he has placed the principal Marks of Authority or Supremacy. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Notion is founded on Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſo clear and convincing, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reaſon dictates an Allegiance, as forcibly from a Paternal Power as that of Compact, tho' there were nothing in the Nature of the former that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feres with the Hypotheſis of the latter; for an Allegiance which derives from Compact, muſt reſt upon the Authority of Compact, whereby it becomes indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſably binding to all the Ends and Purpoſes of Civil Government. And I think natural Reaſon, upon the received Laws of the Creation, as clearly fixes an Allegiance in the Paternal Power, as a Law of God and Nature, as it pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the Maintainance of ſuch Compacts, a Law of God or Nature. But then if upon Matter of Fact, or the revealed Methods of the Creation, there is any
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:135106:103"/>thing repugnant to ſuch a Compact, the Authority of a Paternal Allegiance can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be rejected. Now we profeſs and believe, that <hi>Adam</hi> was the Father of Mankind; for even the Woman of whom the reſt of his Progeny was to be Born, by an Omnipotent Power iſſued forth of him; and ſince it's concluded, That for this Reaſon as well as for the Offices of his Paternal Function, a real Superiority as well as a Right of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance is derived to him, we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that his Off-ſpring could not chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge a Right of Compact any way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory to that Preheminence and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority which the Laws of God and Nature had thus placed him in. In a word, it's manifeſt his Age, his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Experience gave him a civil Preheminence over his Off-ſpring, and if we add this to his Paternal Rights, Reaſon will force us to acknowledge an Authoritative Superiority. Here is not a bare Priority in Time, or Place, or for Order, or external Ceremony; but a Priority, or rather Superiority in Power and Authority. Now all this loudly expoſes the Conceit of an original State of Equality, without which, there can
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:135106:104"/>be no Colour or Foundation for an ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Contract. Indeed this is a Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture ſo vain and groundleſs, that the Divine Methods in Peopling the World by Deſcent and not by a Multitude at once, is ſufficient to ſhake the Credit of it. And certainly nothing but the wild Suppoſition which Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> has beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to advance his Hypotheſis, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted by Matter of Fact, (I mean a Multitude of Men, by Divine Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſprung up like Muſhrooms) or an open Renunciation of the Hiſtory of the Creation, can aſſert the Doctrine of a natural Equality. But to conſider the Argument of Compact a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: It's certain, Compact is no further valid, than it is materially, or intrinſical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good; and therefore no one can right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully enter into Compact, to reſign up or cancel any Laws of God or Nature, or in a word, any further than it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the true Ends of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and thus far the Neceſſity of Government (without any Injury to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Liberty) ſeems to place its Power and Authority in the Perſon in whom the very Order of Nature, as well ſome peculiar Marks of Sovereignty, have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently fixed it.</p>

                  <p>§. 1. ANd firſt, Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> having fixed the Original of what the World generally calls Principles, <hi>though never ſo remote from Reaſon,</hi> in the Power of Education, whereby they are rivetted in the Mind before the Memory begins to keep a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of their Actions, he obſerves, Men from hence conclude, <hi>That thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, of whoſe Knowledge they can find in 'emſelves no Original, were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Impreſs of God and Nature upon their Minds,</hi> and not taught them <hi>by any one elſe.</hi> This he endeavours to illuſtrate by the Inſtance of Filial Reverence. <hi>Theſe</hi> (ſays he) <hi>they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain and ſubmit to, as many do to their Parents with Veneration; not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:135106:105"/>it is Natural, nor do Children do it, where they are not ſo taught, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe having been always ſo educated, and having no Remembrance of the beginning of this Reſpect, they think it is natural,</hi> Eſſay B. 1. Cap. 3. §. 23.</p>
                  <p>I will not peremptorily limit the Words to a Senſe which they ſeem to expreſs. If Mr. <hi>Lock,</hi> by the Term <hi>Natural,</hi> intends ſo as Native Inſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions are, then I can readily grant that a Filial Veneration is not in this Senſe Natural. But if he affirms that it is not Natural, as Laws of Nature are (which he ſeems to do, when he tells us, that Children would not pay any Veneration, were they not ſo taught) then he muſt pardon me if I cannot joyn with him in the Notion; for I hope I have ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved that Children are naturally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with as ſtrong Propenſions of Filial Reverence and Reſpect, as thoſe in Parents of Parental Tenderneſs and Compaſſion; and that the bare Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Idea or Term Parent, would naturally Actuate theſe native Propenſions in ſuch a manner, as to command not only Solemn Reverence and Reſpect, but Filial Obedience, had
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:135106:105"/>not Education or ill Example ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſomething to the contrary. Indeed, I'm perſwaded, a great deal of Filial Reverence and Duty is worn off by thoſe Devolutions, which the Reaſons and Neceſſities of civil Government have made in the chiefeſt Branches of Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Power; otherwiſe I queſtion not but a Senſe of the higheſt Veneration and Duty, would conſtantly poſſeſs the Minds of Men, as no doubt it did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the firſt Government, where the Supreme Power was both Parent and Sovereign.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>And firſt in order to overturn the Parental Power, as it extends to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. This Gentleman, as well as Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> (tho' both in a different Way) thinks he has gain'd the Field, by proving, that the Mother is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Sharer in that Power which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crews to a Father as a Parent: He proves it from both Teſtaments, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.12. and <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.1. and the Remark is, <hi>Had but this one
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:135106:106"/>thing been well conſidered, without look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any deeper into the Matter, it might perhaps have kept Men from running in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe groſs Miſtakes, they have made about Parents.</hi> Two Treatiſes of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, <hi>Part</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 6. §. 52, 53. Now in Anſwer to this, I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but the Word of God enjoyns Duty and Obedience to both Parents; but he cannot be ignorant but it muſt be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to the Mother, only in a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate manner; for elſe I would fain know how with any colour of Truth or Reaſon he expounds theſe Paſſages. <hi>Thy Deſire ſhall be to thine Husband, and he ſhall rule over thee,</hi> Gen. 3.16. <hi>Wives ſubmit yourſelves unto your own Husbands, as unto the Lord; for the Husband is the Head of the Wife, even as Christ is the Head of the Church. Therefore as the Church is ſubject unto Christ, ſo let the Wives be unto their own Husbands in every thing,</hi> Eph. 5.22. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> is as large on the ſame Argument, to whom I ſhall refer him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3. So that it's evident the revealed Law gives a ſupereminent Power to the Father, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as a Father, as well as a Husband; ſince the Wife is to <hi>obey in all things,</hi>
                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:135106:106"/>and conſequently to give place to his Authority, in laying his juſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand upon his Children.</p>
                  <p>But further, the natural Frame of Man, not only in reſpect of Strength and Vigour of Body, but Courage and Reſolution of Mind, ſeems to give him ſo much Superiority and Preheminence, as by the Dictates of Natural Reaſon is ſufficient to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh a ſupereminent Power and Authority to that of the Woman: I'm ſure the holy Spirit draws the Character not unlike this, when the Woman is ſtil'd <hi>The weaker Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel.</hi> But now, in the preſent Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we are to have recourſe to Matter of Fact, by conſidering the Method God took in the Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Woman; for the Diſpute being whether <hi>de facto,</hi> the Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Power of <hi>Adam</hi> was Superemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to that of the Woman; It's abundantly concluded if it be made appear from the eſtabliſhed Methods of the Creation; and the Argument is the ſame in the Original of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for this is to be taken from Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:135106:107"/>of Fact, eſpecially as long as 'tis recorded and tranſmitted upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable Authority; and when once the Original of Government is fixed, the Succeſſion of Governments will eaſily be accounted for, without Projecting an imaginary State of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Equality, and original Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact upon it. It is not my Buſineſs now to draw the Scheme, but if this Author will not be content without it, he ſhall have it upon Demand; and therefore it's unpardonable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance in thoſe that receive the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Creation, to erect a Scheme without any regard to it, or rather ſuch as is highly inconſiſtent with the plain Doctrines of it.</p>
                  <p>But to return, the Records of the Creation aſſure us, That the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or Mother of Mankind, took her Being from the Man; God did not think fit to give her an Original Independent of the Man, by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Creation from common Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but made her a Debtor to the Man, by forming her of his Fleſh and Blood; and therefore if this is
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:135106:107"/>allowed, natural Reaſon will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it a Mark of natural Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and conſequently aſſign her no more than a ſubordinate Authority. I'm ſure the holy Spirit remarks as much, where we are expreſly told, <hi>The Head of the Woman is the Man,</hi> and that <hi>He is the Image and Glory of God; but the Woman is the Glory of the Man, for the Man is not made of the Woman, but the Woman of the Man; neither is the Man created for the Woman, but the Woman for the Man,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.3, 7, 8, 9.</p>
                  <p>But further, If a natural Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on does not Reſult from the Laws of Creation, we may find it eſtabliſh'd by a Poſitive Law: <hi>For thy Deſire ſhall be to thy Husband, and he ſhall Rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thee,</hi> Gen. 3.16. Indeed it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves our Notice to obſerve how this Author labours to droll away the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Text, by expoſing <hi>Adam</hi>'s Monarchy, being in the next Verſe, in his own Language, <hi>Condemned to be a Day-labourer for Life,</hi> Pa. 1. Cap. 5. §. 44, 45. But who ſees not thro' the Weakneſs of the Harangue, for
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:135106:108"/>after all his Tricks and Inſinuations he's not able to prove that God has not placed the Woman in a State of Subjection, tho' it be interpreted as part of her Puniſhment, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently eſtabliſhed a ſupereminent Power and Authority in <hi>Adam,</hi> tho' he wanted not his Puniſhment in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condemned to reap the Bleſſings of this Life, even of Government itſelf, in continual Sweat and Labour. Here is not a ſupereminent Power eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Compact, but conferred by God himſelf. Indeed it's indiſputably e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, all thoſe Rights of Dominion that were inveſted in <hi>Adam,</hi> even that which reſults from his Conjugal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, was conferred by God; for tho' God was pleaſed to leave the Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Eſtate of his Deſcendents, to be eſtabliſhed upon voluntary Contracts, he thought fit to make his an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Grant as well as the Authority of it. But then, tho' the entring into a State of Matrimony now is a pure Compact, yet the Authority that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives upon the Husband from it, is by no means a piece of Compact; this is
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:135106:108"/>eſtabliſhed by God alone in the firſt Inſtitution of Matrimony, and enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by After-laws.</p>
                  <p>The Sum of all is this, The Rights of Parental Juriſdiction conſidered in the Nature of the Thing itſelf, had been in common to our firſt Parents, had not God ſignified the contrary, by giving the <hi>Woman</hi> a Being from the <hi>Man,</hi> and aſſigning him a ſupere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Power by an expreſs Law; and ſince this is abundantly evinced, I hope an imaginary State of Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or Freedom ſhall not hinder God from limiting his own Ordinances at Pleaſure; and conſequently the Rights of the Paternal Power are indiſputably inveſted in the Fatherhood. Here is the main Effort of our Adverſaries; for the only Artifice to ſtrip the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood of all civil Juriſdiction, was to clog the Notion with Abſurdities, by contending for a joynt Juriſdiction in the Mother, upon the Foundations of the Parental Power; and therefore this being ſet aſide, there is nothing left that is of force to Diſcard any of thoſe Prerogatives that have hitherto been aſſigned.</p>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:135106:109"/>
                  <p>But to proceed, He tells us that the Parental and Political Power <hi>are ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly Diſtinct and Separate, and Built upon ſo different Foundations, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to ſo different Ends, that every Subject that is a Father, has as much a Paternal Power over his Children as the Prince has over his,</hi> Ib. §. 7. But it's manifeſt the Argument is, concerning Paternal and Political Power, as it was in the original Inſtitution of 'em. And it's already granted, that Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Political Power, as exerciſed in the preſent Governments of the World, are viſibly diſtinguiſhed; but it cannot be an Argument they were ſo in their Original. The preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments of the World reſt upon dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Foundations from what Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment did in its Original, and yet it does not follow that their Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was an original Compact from a perfect State of Nature or Equality, for I defie this Author to prove that there was ever any Body of Men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly and <hi>de jure</hi> in ſuch a State, ſince the Creation, unleſs Manumit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Civil Power.</p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:135106:109"/>
                  <p>Again, the Exerciſe of the Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Power in private Families, that are the Deſcendents of <hi>Adam,</hi> is vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly different from what it was in the Original; for God having made Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment neceſſary to the Support of Mankind, it was abſolutely neceſſary that that part of the Paternal Power, which conſiſts in Governing by Laws, ſhould devolve from Under-families upon <hi>Adam,</hi> and conſequently in Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-governments it muſt ſtill remain in the Father of each reſpective Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or in other Terms in the Governing Power. But notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this, the commanding Power and Authority, which has been abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly aſſerted to be in the original Rights of the Paternal Power, by the Laws of God, and the Reaſons of the thing, ſtill remains in private Parents or Fathers, where the Civil Power has not expreſly interpoſed, or where it's neceſſary it ſhould exert itſelf in the Conduct of Humane Life. But to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate from eternal Diſtinction of Paternal from Political Government, he, in another place, preſents us with
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:135106:110"/>an Inſtance of a Stranger's coming into a Family, who ſhould Kill one of the Patriarch's Children; upon which he allows the Patriarch a Power to put him to Death, and yet he ſays it's impoſſible he ſhould do it <hi>by Vertue of any Paternal Authority,</hi> Ib. §. 74. Now, for my part, I'm ſo far from diſcerning any Impoſſibility, that I cannot fathom the Conſequence of the Argument. For certainly unleſs he would beg the Queſtion, or pronounce it Impoſſible, that a Paternal Power ſhould imploy a Coercive Power in it, within the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricts of its Government, over all thoſe that diſturb the Peace of it; why may not the Power of Capital Puniſhments be attributed to a Paternal Power, without a Conſent or Deputation from thoſe Children that are the principal Members of it? Though he cannot puniſh the Stranger as his own Off-ſpring, yet if a Political Power branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es itſelf from a Paternal Power (as has been ſufficiently proved) I hope no one can deny but there is ſuch Powers lodged in it as are ſufficient to ſecure the Ends of Government, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:135106:110"/>a Coercive Power to Puniſh any from within or without, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the Peace of it.</p>
                  <p>But 3dly, To ſupport his own Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis, and avoid the Political Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Paternal Power, he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, That tho' the Duties of Honour and Reſpect are Eternal, yet the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Power is Temporary, and ceaſes with Nonage or Minority. See § 64, 67, 69, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That when this Power expires, Children are in as abſolute a State of Freedom as the Father, and that too, not only in reſpect to the Father's Authority, but of the Civil Government. This is the Subſtance of ſeveral Sections, and it's very viſible, that his chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Arguments are raiſed upon Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Power, as 'tis exercis'd under the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed Governments of the World, which is a Fallacy already detected. But to make ſome Returns according to Method and Order. The Duty of Children I'm perſuaded, in the full Extent of it, is of eternal Obligation, where 'tis not ſuperſeeded by a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Law, that of Society, upon which account alone (as is already obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved)
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:135106:111"/>part of it by the Reaſon and Neceſſity of Things devolves upon the Supreme Power. Indeed, if what has been aſſerted carries Evidence and Truth in it, the Duty of Children muſt be Eternal. It has been abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly proved, That the Ground or Foundation of Filial Duty and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is Eternal, <hi>viz.</hi> That of Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and an unchangeable Affection reſulting from it: And if the Ground of Obligation is eternal, the Duty muſt be ſo too.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed, the Word of God ſeems expreſs in this Matter; for we are not only enjoyned to Honour, but Obey our Parents. Now it's well known, Obedience ſuppoſes a decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Power, or commanding Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and the Precept not being given under any Limitations that make it Temporary, I cannot diſcern by what Authority this Gentleman pronounces it Temporary. Indeed I cannot imagine how any one that receives the Holy Scriptures for the Word of God, can ſafely pronounce the Duty of Filial Obedience Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary; for we there find it eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:135106:111"/>and enforced upon ſuch ample Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, that we muſt believe God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to perpetuate the Obligations of it. The time would fail me to collect all the Paſſages that manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly favour this Notion; I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore touch on a few that are very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, the Power of Bleſſing and Curſing exerciſed by the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, is a conſiderable Evidence of the Perpetuity of the Duty: It's well known the Patriarchs conſtantly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed this Power, and their Deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents as conſcienciouſly acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it.</p>
                  <p>It was a Senſe of this Power, that made <hi>Jacob</hi> Expoſtulate before he embraced his Mother's Expedient: <hi>My Father peradvanture will feel me, and I ſhall be to him as a Deceiver; and I ſhall bring a Curſe upon me, and not a Bleſſing,</hi> Gen. 27. <hi>v.</hi> 12. It's certain the Patriarchs challenged an indiſputable Right to exerciſe this Power; for tho' <hi>Jacob</hi> had obtained the Bleſſing by an ungenerous Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, or Stratagem, yet <hi>Iſaac</hi> thought himſelf obliged to confirm it; <hi>I have
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:135106:112"/>bleſſed him, yea, and he ſhall be bleſſed,</hi> v. 33. A moſt convincing Argument truly, that this Right of Bleſſing and Curſing was founded in a Divine Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal; and certainly there needs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to demonſtrate the Divine Will and Pleaſure than the inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Effects and Conſequences of his Power, ſince we find that the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings or Curſes of Parents as infallibly purſued their Children as they were diſpenſed. Thus the Bleſſing of <hi>Iſaac</hi> attended <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the Curſes of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> purſued his Son <hi>Canaan: Curſed be</hi> Canaan; <hi>a Servant of Servants ſhall he be unto his Brethren,</hi> Gen. 9. <hi>v.</hi> 25. Now certainly a Proviſion of ſuch ſpecial Powers can carry no leſs a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in it than the perpetuating of a Filial Reverence and Duty: If God had not deſign'd to eſtabliſh an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Power and Authority in the Parent, why ſhould he confer ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing Marks of Sovereignty and Dominion? Can we imagin, that ſuch a tremendous Power was exerted purely to ſecure an Obedience during Minority, and a ceremonious Reverence afterwards excluſive of a
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:135106:112"/>commanding Authority? No certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this is a Conjecture, that runs counter to all the Accounts of Time; for the Obedience of Children in the firſt Ages of the World was as remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as the Parents Commands after a State of Maturity; and indeed it could proceed from nothing leſs than a juſt Senſe of an indeleble Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter and Authority, as well as Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to enforce it.</p>
                  <p>But further, the Duty and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Children is ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any wiſe Temporary, that God has given his own expreſs Promiſes to perpetuate the Obligation. St. <hi>Paul</hi> has long ſince obſerv'd, that, <hi>Children obey your Parents, is the first Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with Promiſe,</hi> Epheſ. 6.1, 2. And certainly where the Sanction is peculiar or extraordinary, the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Command muſt bear a proportion to it; and where God has diſcover'd himſelf ſo eminently ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous to enforce the Duty by ſpecial Rewards as well as Puniſhments, we may conclude he intended to perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate it. Thus far the Suffrage of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſeems clear and indiſputable:
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:135106:113"/>But if all this will not convince, I ſhall refer this Author to the Story of <hi>Jonadab,</hi> the Son of <hi>Rechab,</hi> out of the very Mouth of the Prophet: The Command or Prohibition was againſt drinking of Wine as well as building of Houſes, which ſeems to be an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgment of the Natural Liberties of Mankind, and conſequently if the Commanding Power of Parents cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes with Nonage, it may very well do ſo in Caſes of this Nature. But inſtead of this, we find the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation aſſerted by a Complication of Arguments; <hi>Jonadab</hi> advances the Command by virtue of a Parental Power and Authority: <hi>Ye ſhall drink no Wine, neither ye nor your Sons for ever, that ye may live many Days where ye be Strangers,</hi> Jer. 35. v. 6, 7. <hi>The very Commandment with Promiſe.</hi> And the <hi>Rechabites</hi> were poſſeſſed with as deep a Senſe of its Obligation; for when the Prophet, by the Command of God, tryed their Fidelity, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Argument of their Non-compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, was the Command of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Jonadab,</hi> and the Proſpect of Inheriting the Bleſſing annexed to
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:135106:113"/>the Command, <hi>Thus have we obeyed the Voice of</hi> Jonadab <hi>our Father, and done all that</hi> Jonadab <hi>our Father com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us,</hi> v. 8, 9. But this is not all, for the Obligation of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is not only recogniſed by Men, even thoſe that were immediately concerned in it, but by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; for he does not only annex the Promiſe of the Command, to the Obſervance of it: <hi>Becauſe ye have obeyed the Commandment of</hi> Jonadab <hi>your Father, and kept all his Precepts — Therefore</hi> Jonadab, <hi>the Son of</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chab, <hi>ſhall not want a Man to ſtand before me for ever,</hi> v. 18, 19. But ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly repreſents that eternal Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that is due to his Commands by it; for this was God's Deſign in obliging the Prophet to try the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabites</hi> Conſtancy and Perſeverance, by ſetting Cups and Pots full of Wine before them, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to Drink; and therefore the Inference is Recorded: <hi>Go and tell the Men of</hi> Judah, <hi>and the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>Will ye not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Inſtruction to hearken to my Words? The Words of</hi> Jonadab, <hi>the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:135106:114"/>Son of</hi> Rechab, <hi>that he commanded his Sons are performed; for unto this Day they drink</hi> no Wine, <hi>but obey their Father's Commandment: Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding I have ſpoken unto you, riſing up early, and ſpeaking, but ye hearkned not unto me,</hi> v. 13, 14. And now how can any Man diſpute the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity of a Commanding Paternal Power. Has not God himſelf drawn the Parallel? If his Commanding Power is not Temporary, neither is that of the Parent. The Nature of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand might have engaged a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Advocate againſt it, the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Immunities of a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Being, but yet the Conſcience of ſo juſt a Superior, bearing ſo awful a Character as that of a Father, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands an immediate Submiſſion. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this ſingle Inſtance repreſents it as a Doctrine univerſally received, and in thoſe Ages undiſputed; and therefore I preſume it will be a Task of ſome difficulty for this Author to produce a Diſpenſation, much more a Repeal under the Goſpel OEcono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:135106:114"/>
                  <p>But I proceed to conſider the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments already advanced to ſupport the Notion, and I find the main and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Argument is formed from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Reaſon of Paternal Authority; for the Author, expreſly reſolves the commanding Power into <hi>a help to the weakneſs, and imperfections of their Nonage, a Diſcipline neceſſary to their Education, but when they are once arrived to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchiſement of the Years of Diſcretion, the Father's Empire then ceaſes. Sect.</hi> 65. But let us conſider this in the Inſtance already given, that of our firſt Parent. I would demand of this Gentleman, whether after Years of Diſcretion, a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of Civil Commands, and Laws, were not abſolutely neceſſary for the Conduct of our Lives and Actions; yet as neceſſary as a commanding Diſcipline to a Child's Education. If therefore Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Government from the beginning was neceſſary, even for Adult Perſons, this Diſcipline muſt be ſo too; and then let Reaſon determine whether this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Authoritative Power, or this Diſcipline of giving Laws, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands was not Appropriate to <hi>Adam,</hi> in whom God had inveſted all deligated Power and Authority; and that too
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:135106:115"/>under the higeſt marks of Sovereignty, and Dominion. I'm perſwaded an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biaſſed Perſon would pronounce ſuch a Title unqueſtionable, when there is no expreſs Law that declares the contrary. Again he tells us, <hi>The Power which Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents have over their Children ariſes from that Duty which is incumbent on them, to take care of their Off-ſpring during the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect State of Childhood. See Sect.</hi> 58. But I am perſwaded, I have with good Evidence fixed it on a diſtinct Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Parental Duty, indeed, is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Reaſon, that God ſhould Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a Right of Dominion, but it is no Argument that he has Eſtabliſhed it on this Foundation: no, I have proved the contrary. But admit we, that a Parental Right of Dominion was found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Duties of a Parent, yet if Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rental Duty be perpetual, a Parental Right of Dominion muſt be ſo too. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, to give colour to this uncouth Notion, he Suggeſts, that that part of Parental Duty which conſiſts in Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, ceaſes when the buſineſs of Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is over, he means when Nonage ceaſes. <hi>Sect.</hi> 69. But certainly, if In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, or Commands are at any time neceſſary, and not ſuperſeded by a
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:135106:115"/>higher Power, it's the Indiſpenſible Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Father to enjoyn them, and the Duty of Children to embrace them. I preſume Chriſtianity will inſtruct eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry believing Father, that a Child's Age, or Abilities can never exempt him from giving ſuch Counſels, and Precepts (if he ſtands in need of them,) as may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him to live in the Nurture and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition of the Lord. Upon the whole then, the Commands of private Parents af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Nonage, are for the moſt part ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeded, by the ample proviſions of the Civil Power in all Regular Governments: and in like manner, the power of Puniſhments is juſtly taken away upon that Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, or Property, which the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment challenges in all its Members; but yet if any thing is omitted in the Civil Power neceſſary to the Conduct of the Child's Life, I am perſwaded the Parent is not only to adminiſter Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, but lay his Commands, and the Child is indiſpenſibly obliged to yield a Conſciencious Obedience, upon a juſt Deference to the Parents's Character, and Authority. This is to obey, <hi>as unto God and Chriſt, and not unto Men.</hi> This Author freely confeſſes, that the Duty of Piety expreſſed not only in Acts of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:135106:116"/>Reverence, and Reſpect, but in ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and defending the Perſons of our Parents, is perpetual; and I am perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there can be no Juſt Reaſon aſſigned, why a Reverential Obedience to juſt and reaſonable Commands is not perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual too; it is indeed replyed, that the former Reſults from the Laws of Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, founded in Benefit, ſo inexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the one can never be Cancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, nor the other Compenſated; but I hope, it is proved they are founded in ſomething beſides, that ſerves to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate an Obligation; and ſince a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Power has the ſame Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Foundation, I cannot conceive why an Obedience to the Commands of Parents ſhould not be perpetual, where God ſeems to have made ſuch Commands neceſſary to the Conduct of Humane Life. Thus far here's no Foundation given for the Suggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Author has made in extending the Goſpel Precept to a commanding Power, as if by virtue of it a Parent ſhould pretend to treat an Adult Son ſtill as a Boy. <hi>Sect.</hi> 68. For the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſuch commands is ſuperſeded by the circumſtances of Age, and Perſonal Abilities; and tho it is reaſonable to

Sect.</hi> 63. Now I am content to put the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on this iſſue, with a ſmall matter added to it. If Man at a certain period
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:135106:117"/>is endued with a ſufficiency of Reaſon to inſtruct him in that Law he is to govern himſelf by, and make him know how far he is left to the Freedom of his own Will, and had Ingenuity, and Integrity enough to proſecute it, then I will grant that he may challenge a Freedom, or Liberty of acting accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own Will without being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to any one, till his own vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Compact had made him ſo: But then ſuch a ſufficiency as this, muſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſede the neceſſity of all Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or poſitive Laws; Certainly then if Man after the utmoſt pretences to Reaſon, has not a ſufficiency of Reaſon at all times to inſtruct himſelf in the Line of Duty, no more than Integrity to adjudge his own Actions conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Line of Duty; we may with very good Reaſon conclude, that Matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Reaſon does not cancel the Bonds of Filial Obedience, or (to have reſpect to the inſtance before us,) admit the Children of <hi>Adam</hi> to an equal State of Liberty with himſelf, that is, in his own Language, <hi>To challenge an Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power in the Exerciſe of Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as much as their Father, as well as Preſcribe to their own Will, and regulate
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:135106:117"/>their Actions.</hi> Theſe are poſitions that can no way be reconciled with the neceſſity of civil Government, under the moſt improv'd State of Reaſon, and that Dominion which by the Laws of the Creation, God had inveſted him with; for God having made Government neceſſary for the Support of Grown Men, and actually Inveſted <hi>Adam</hi> with a Right of Dominion; Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon muſt determine without the breach of Humane Freedom, that the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Adam,</hi> was Originally deſigned to extend as far as was neceſſary to the Regulation, and Conduct of Humane Actions, as well by Laws, as Counſel. Indeed, the original Miſtake is lodged in the Notion of Civil Government compared with Humane Freedom; as if Humane Freedom, or Natural Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, were, in the very Notion of it, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with Government, or as if it were a Breach of Natural Liberty to be placed under the Conduct of that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, Man with all his Reaſon cannot Subſiſt, much leſs be Happy. Now it is viſible, tho' Government im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a Power of impoſing, and enforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Laws, yet the Original Deſign of it was the Happineſs of Mankind in the Regulation of their Lives and Actions,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:135106:118"/>according to the Laws of God, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Natural, or Revealed. It is true, the Inſtitution of ſuch a Power may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply an abſolute Truſt, and whether this Truſt is forfeited, and accountable, when the Original Ends of Government are Violated, is another Queſtion. But it is Indiſputable theſe are the only true ends of Government. And I think, no one can affirm, that the direct Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods to Happineſs are Breaches of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Freedom, yea rather, they are the only Expedients to preſerve it, and therefore I can ſee no Rights in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Humane Reaſon, or Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom founded on it, to Exempt the Children of <hi>Adam</hi> from that Civil Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction that Reſults from his Paternal Power. And now I preſume there is enough offered to Reject the pretence of an unlimitted Freedom, I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged more plentifully upon it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the Foundation of that State of Equality, upon which Compact is made the firſt Principle of Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; for this reaſon I ſhall offer a few Arguments more, to repreſent the Abſurdity of it.</p>

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:135106:118"/>diſcharged from their Paternal Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but acquire a State of Freedom equal to their Father, as this Poſition directs, <hi>Sect.</hi> 66. Then the Children of <hi>Adam,</hi> had an unqueſtionable Right to erect a Government over his Head, or at leaſt upon Non-compliance to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude him from the Benefits of it; and in a word, to drive him forth from his own Territories; ſince Civil Governments always challenge a Power to Baniſh thoſe that refuſe to pay Allegiance to them. That the Children, and Deſcendants of <hi>Adam</hi> could act thus, is evident; for as they were in a State of Freedom, and Equality, they could enter into a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact at Pleaſure, and conſequently Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a Government upon a Majority a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Fathers. It's highly Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the Children of our Firſt Parent were acted by ſo deep a ſenſe of Duty, as would prevent them from the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting their pretended Privilege; but I am perſwaded, were a Set of Men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Influence of this Author's Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, placed in a State of Nature under their Natural Father, the Reſentments which the Diſcipline of their Education might give them, would eaſily engage them to bandy together at ſuch a rate,

However it is manifeſt, this Poſition will Vindicate the Lawfulneſs of the Project, and therefore it can be no Crime to apply it to the Father of Mankind, and his immediate Deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants.

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:135106:119"/>this Author is forced to Diſcard the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Natural Allegiance, and place every one in a State of Liberty upon their arrival at Years of Diſcetion, till they ſhall Recognize the Governing Power by an expreſs, or tacit Conſent. An expreſs Conſent he fixes in Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or Oaths of Allegiance, and a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit Conſent <hi>in the Poſſeſſion or Enjoyment of any part of the Dominions of any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, Chap.</hi> 8. <hi>Sect.</hi> 119. <hi>Part.</hi> 2.

Sect.</hi> 121. Now certainly theſe are Poſitions that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well be conſiſtent with the ſafety of any Government; for it is manifeſt, they give a Latitude for Rebellion, as well as Diſertion. For <hi>firſt,</hi> The Deſcendants of the Liege Subjects of any Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment do not yield a Tacit Conſent even after they arrive at Years of Diſcretion, by Living, and Subſiſting upon the Bleſſings of it, unleſs they poſſeſs, or

If this be true, as the caſe now ſtands in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government, where Oaths of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance are only required but upon Special Occaſions, and where purſuant to our Law, in ſome caſes; he has fixed the term of Nonage at <hi>Twenty One,</hi> he muſt neceſſarily bring a Majority of <hi>Effective Men</hi> within a State of Nature? and therefore tho upon his Principles a Right doth not accrue to the Poſſeſſions of an Eſtabliſhed Government, yet in caſe an Eſtabliſhed Government does not think fit to treat them as Men in a State of Nature, or happens to exerciſe the leaſt ſhadow of Rigour, or Severity upon them, they are according to rule (his own I mean) the proper Executioners of Laws of Nature, and conſequently, they have Right of War, not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Common, but Natural Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. And truely, I do not ſee but a
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:135106:120"/>Project of this nature might prove ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly ſucceſsful, for purſuant to this Learned Hypotheſis, a Body of Rich Male-Contents that have not entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an expreſs Allegiance, have power to ſell their real Poſſeſſions, and when this is done, they are to all intents, and purpoſes in a State of Nature, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently are prepared upon the firſt Alarm to become Generals to worthy Mobile, and invade their Neighbours Poſſeſſions with Thouſands, and ten Thouſands. Oh!

                  <p>And <hi>firſt,</hi> it is on all Hands agreed, that Perſons, as well as Things, may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Property, and Property in the Judgment of the Learned, eſtabliſheth a Right of Dominion; Conſent at leaſt ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Perſons, or free Agents, as much a Property as neceſſary Agents. Now the diſpute is, whether free Agents may
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:135106:121"/>not become a Property any other way than by Conſent. It's obſervable, he reſolves the Foundation of Property in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Labour, ſo that whatever is the effect of Labour and Induſtry, or has Labour mixed with it, becomes a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, <hi>See Chap.</hi> 5. <hi>Sect.</hi> 27, 45. II. <hi>Part.</hi> Now it's manifeſt, not only the Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Subſiſtence of Miners, but of thouſands of Perſons that have not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly Subſcribed to any Government, is carried on by the Labour, Care, and Conduct of the Government, as well as that of their natural Parents; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Reaſon does not ſuggeſt any thing to me, why they are not from their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Infancy to be eſteemed a Property of the Government, and conſequently a kind of Allegiance, as it were grows up with them to the Government, as well as to their Natural Parents. It's true, it is a Property highly diſtinct from that in Brutes, for the one ſeems to be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, whereas the other muſt be limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that is, <hi>to Rational Ends, and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes.</hi> In this Senſe, a free Agent may be a Property of the Supreme Power, as well as that of <hi>Terra firma</hi> in another. But now, ſince the Civil Power chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth a Property, it cannot be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:135106:121"/>than by vertue of the Character it ſelf; I mean that of a Governing Power, and conſequently the Property that accrews from it, muſt Eſtabliſh a Right of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience purſuant to it. In a word, the Governing Power challenges a Right of Labour and Aſſiſtance, in order to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Strength, and Grandeur of the Community, and conſequently, the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power muſt be inveſted with Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to impoſe Laws for the regulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and exacting of this Labour, and Induſtry. This is a truth ſo unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable, that all Eſtabliſhed Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments conſtantly challenge ſuch Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices as every Home-born Subject is capable of yielding, and exerciſe Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction over them with as full Power, as if they had actually Subſcribed to its Authority. This they eſteem an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Prerogative, notwithſtanding any Pretences to a State of Freedom af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Nonage. From all this it appears, how unjuſt this Author's Poſition is in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing all thoſe that have not entered into an expreſs Allegiance to deſert a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment at pleaſure; for if the Laws and Meaſures of Property advanced by this Author, give the Supreme Power a Right of Dominion over every Home-born
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:135106:122"/>Subject, antecedent to all Subſcriptions, as I think has been abundantly evinced, the Subject cannot rightfully withdraw himſelf from his Native Country with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Special Licenſe from the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I know this is a Queſtion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted by <hi>Grotius, Pufendorf,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and they generally agree, that they cannot rightfully withdraw <hi>Grega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim,</hi> becauſe it muſt deſtroy the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of Government; but <hi>Pufendorf</hi> argues well, that if one particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon has a right to withdraw; a Second and Third muſt have ſo too, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a multitude, or Body of Men, either jointly or ſeparately. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it is univerſally allowed, that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments may preſcribe Laws in this Affair; and certainly, if a Government can without the expreſs conſent of theſe pretended Free-Born Perſons rightfully bind them by Laws, I think the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment has a Right of Allegiance An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to Law; for no Government can pretend a Power of binding by Law, eſpecially, contrary to a Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, Natural Right, where an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent Right of Dominion is wanting, without Compact, or Conſent. This is current Doctrine, at leaſt with our
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:135106:122"/>Author, the Man for <hi>Original contract:</hi> In a word, the Sum of what has been hitherto offered by the Learned, is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the practices of particular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, rather than from the Nature or Reaſon of the thing. Indeed it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied, but that particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have withdrawn from their Native Country, but it is to be interpreted by Permiſſion, or Connivance, not by a Right of Natural Freedom, for there can no juſt Reaſon be aſſigned, why Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as well as Things, may not become a property of the Government, or why a Property is not acquired in both, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuant to their proper Ends and Uſes, by the ſame Laws and Meaſures; ſo that the Labour and Conduct of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in preſerving, and ſupporting our Perſons, may render us a Property of it to all the true ends and purpoſes of Government, in a rational way, or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as much as the Occupation or quiet Enjoyment, of any tract of Land render it a branch of its Dominions. Thus far I queſtion not but the Government has a Right, or Property, in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and Service of every adult Native, as truly as in the product of the Ground, or the Riches and Treaſures of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:135106:123"/>and therefore it's abſurd to imagine that any one can rightfully withdraw his Perſon, much leſs his Effects, or Treaſure, and commit himſelf and them to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Government, whether new or old. As for this Author, he's ſo highly ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible how much the number of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects contributes to the Trade, Riches, Strength and Glory of a Nation; that were the queſtion formally put and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued in the Council of Trade, and his Preferments, as well as Judgment, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged upon it, I'm perſwaded he would think himſelf obliged to declare againſt his former Sentiments. In one Word, it's evident theſe are poſitions, that (without a Law that enjoyns an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal explicit Allegiance) muſt render every Government highly precarious; for if a ſingle Perſon can challenge a Right of withdrawing, then may a Second and a Third, and ſo on to a Body, or Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and by this Means a Nation may not only be diſpeopled at pleaſure, and conſequently drained of her Riches and Treaſure, but her own natural Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects may become her moſt formidable Enemies.</p>
                  <p>And now having offered what is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to expoſe the conceipt of natural
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:135106:123"/>Freedom, I think I have abundantly evinced what was before aſſerted, That there cannot be a Body of Men, regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly and <hi>de jure</hi> in ſuch a State of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as this Author has projected. For tho' we ſhould allow the firſt Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be formed upon compact from a State of Nature, yet if Subjects are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally a property of a Government, it's impoſſible there ſhould be a Body of Men, in a perfect State of Nature, without a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal diſſolution of particular Governments; for as for the Independant State of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Powers, produced as an Inſtance by this Author, he knows very well it proves nothing to his deſign, or purpoſe, that is a body of Men in a State of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, from which a Government is form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Force and Authority of a joint compact. 2dly, This Notion of a State of Freedom being ſo clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by that property, which every Government challenges in all the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of it, as well as every Father in their Children; I think it adds to the ſtrength of former Arguments in aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Civil Prerogatives of the Paternal Power; as it lay in the original. For <hi>Adam</hi> being not only the Great Parent of Mankind, but the ſole proprietary of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:135106:124"/>Off-Springs, without any Collateral, much leſs Superior Power to defaulk from any of his Prerogatives; if Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the Laws of Providence was truly ſerviceable, or rather neceſſary, the very Station, as well as Character he bare, is ſufficient to give him a right of Dominion and Sovereignty. And thus far, I hope I have, in ſome meaſure, ſtated the Foundations of Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, purſuant to the Eſtabliſhed Laws of the Creation; and certainly when all Arguments and Circumſtances are fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laid together, there's no juſt ground or colour for <hi>Original Compact.</hi> Here's a manifeſt Power and truſt, but it ſeems to be the immediate Ordinance and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God, ariſing from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed Frame and order of Things; Not an Arbitrary Deputation or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, iſſuing forth of the hands of the People, that were born and formed for Government, and Educated and nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up under the Wings of it. I have proved it from the nature of the Thing, and the Laws of Providence, and were we to enquire into the Original of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments upon matter of Fact, we ſhall find them inveſted in the Paternal Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; indeed this Author is forced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:135106:124"/>as much, and then I think not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Tacit conſent, or compact, as he would have it, no, the frame of Nature directs us to another foundation. And now I muſt own the Argument has car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried me much further than I deſigned, but I think the injuries which theſe No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions offer to the Authority of Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, as ell as Maſters of Families; will dictate an Apology. I have ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly avoided all Applications, leſt I ſhould give him a Handle to make uſe of a Common Artifice againſt me, by reſolving my Reſentments into diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, towards our preſent Sovereign; but this is an Imputation ſo unjuſt, that all that know me are, I queſtion not, ſufficiently prepared to wipe it off: For tho' I cannot entertain ſuch an Opinion of Original Contract, as to be forward to place all my Loyalty upon it, yet I hope there are others as well as my ſelf, can find out principles that will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain as true fealty and Allegiance, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his preſent Majeſty, as that can ſuggeſt, or create.</p>

               <p>HAving thus laid the Foundations of the Law of Nature, and repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it in all its Formalities and Appendages, I proceed in the next place to conſider the nature and diſtinction of Moral Good, and Evil. And firſt, That we may deſcribe the nature of Moral Good with greater clearneſs, it will be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to conſider not only the <hi>Subject Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> but the <hi>Formal Reaſons</hi> of it.</p>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <p>§. 1. And firſt, The ſubject Matter of Moral Good undoubtedly ariſes from the natural frame and conſtitution of Things. As things in their Original Nature correſpond, or agree with the Primitive ends, and Intereſts of each other, ſo they carry in them a Natural, or Phyſical goodneſs. Thus in the caſe of Temperance; a moderate uſe of Meats and Drinks, undoubtedly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the Mind, as well as Body in all its ends and uſes? and conſequently it is no doubt, a Natural, or Phyſical good
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:135106:125"/>to the whole Man. And this I would call the ſubject matter of Moral Good; ſo that all Moral Good being founded in the Original Frame and Conſtitution of things, it always implies a Phyſical, or Natural Good in it. But,</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="section">
                  <p>§. 2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the <hi>formal Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> of Moral Good, I conceive they are principally <hi>two.</hi> The <hi>firſt</hi> is, whereby it ſeems to be immediately diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from a Natural Good; and that is as it proceeds from the choices of a free Agent. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> As theſe choices are Regulated, according to the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Frame, Nature, and Order of things Thus in the caſe of Meats and Drinks, an unthinking Brute may, no doubt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſuch a portion of both, as is exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accommodated to the Ends and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of ſuch an Animal. But yet, ſince this is done purely by a neceſſary prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, or natural Inſtinct, it cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to it ſelf the denomination of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Action; but now when the moderate uſe of Meats and Drinks is defined up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a mature conſideration of the ends and Intereſts of our beings, and we make 'em the meaſure of our choices, and embrace 'em as ſuch; the Action ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:135106:126"/>a new denomination; for 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a Moral Action, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Moral Good, in as much as it moves upon the meaſures, and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of a Natural Good.</p>
                  <p>It's certain, every action that is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in rational Motives and Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or that reſts on certain Faculties which we are empowered to exert, or not exert in the diſquiſition of its Nature is to be eſteemed a moral action, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the conſequences of it are to be imputed to us. And if our choices, and determinations are Regulated accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the true nature of the thing, and the Primitive Ends and Intereſts of our Beings, it may juſtly be eſteemed a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Good; but if we chooſe, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine contrary to theſe meaſures and principles, it will undoubtedly, paſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the character of a moral Evil; ſo that Moral Good manifeſtly includes two things, firſt it muſt contain all the principles of a free Action. Secondly, The Springs, and Principles of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, are to move in conjunction with the natural Frame, and intereſts of the things themſelves; and conſequently, a Moral Good always preſuppoſes, and includes a Natural Good. I'm ſenſible
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:135106:126"/>here are others that are not content with this portion of Moral Good, and therefore they add a third Ingredient, from whence it chiefly takes its deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. For they define it to be the Conformity of an Action to a Rule, or Decree of a Law-giver; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it includes, firſt a principle of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; ſecondly, a Natural Goodneſs, or an intrinſick Rectitude of the Action in all its relations; and thirdly, the bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Authority of a Law that engages us to embrace it from the Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of a Law-giver. But now if the Authority of a Law-giver, be the true meaſure of Moral Goodneſs, it makes a Moral Law, or Duty, and a Moral Good to be the ſame thing, whereas a Moral Law or Duty ſeems to be the Complement of a Moral Good. The one is a choice of things from their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and conſent to Moral ends and purpoſes; the other, from a binding Authority ſuperadded to them. In Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Duties, the Law-giver is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe in Conformity to theſe ends, and the Moral Agent is to chooſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine himſelf by them, in Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Will, and Authority of the Law-giver, but a Moral Good ſeems to
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:135106:127"/>be only the choice of a Natural Good, without conſidering it as the Command, or Appointment of a Sovereign Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. But the denominations of things are often Arbitrary, and may be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or leſſened, without any injury to Truth, as long as the Latitude of ſuch denominations is fixed, and agreed upon; and therefore, we ought not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned at any Terms of Art, or Modes of Expreſſion, as long as there's an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement in the nature of things.</p>

                  <p>§. 1. IN order to a further diſplay of the nature of Moral Goodneſs, it will not be improper, nor uſeleſs to conſider the true meaſure of Moral Goodneſs. And firſt, I think Pleaſure, whether of Body or Mind, cannot be any true meaſure of Moral Goodneſs. Thus much the Obſervations already made on a Vitiated Mind abundantly evince.</p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:135106:127"/>
                  <p>For certainly a Vitiated Mind and Conſcience may conceive an undiſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed Satisfaction, and delight in the fouleſt Enormities; and yet it's abſurd to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce 'em Moral Goods.</p>
                  <p>For notwithſtanding any pleaſure of Mind that accompanies them, they are ſtill to be ranked among Moral Evils. Indeed, I cannot conceive how Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and Pain can be the meaſure of Natural Good; for the Mind may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly lie under wrong apprehenſions of things, and conſequently, conceive a pleaſure, and ſatisfaction in real Evils: and therefore it ſeems to be highly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to pronounce Pleaſure, the true, and only meaſure of Natural, much more of Moral Good. No, certainly the true meaſure of Natural Good is to be taken from the Original Frame, and Conſtitution, or ends and intereſts of things, and the exact Agreement, or Adapting of them to each other, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuant to it. When things are thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apted, no doubt, but a true pleaſure of Mind reſults from them, for God has ſo graciouſly adapted things to our Welfare and Happineſs, and Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch a ſtrict Harmony, and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between us, and every Natural
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:135106:128"/>Good that concerns us, that there's a powerful Pleaſure flows from it, at leaſt according to the Original Oeconomy, or Frame of things; but yet Pleaſure ſeems to be a conſequent rather than a meaſure, or conſtituent Principle of Natural Good, eſpecially ſince there may ariſe this Pleaſure of Mind, when the true ends and intereſts of things are perverted, witneſs the caſe of an Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Judgment, or Conſcience; and therefore I think, a late Author has not well expreſſed himſelf, when he tells us, <hi>That things are Good, and Evil, only in Reference to Pleaſure and Pain</hi> [<hi>Eſſay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Human Underſtanding,</hi> Cap. 20. Sect. 2.] or, as he more fully delivers himſelf in another place, <hi>Good and Evil, are nothing but Pleaſure and Pain, or that which occaſions, or produces Pleaſure, or Pain in us.</hi> Book 2. Cap. 28. Sect. 5.</p>

                  <p>§. 2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The conformity of our Actions to a Law abſtracting from the Intrinſick rectitude of the Subject matter of it, cannot be the true meaſure of Moral Good. As the forecited Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor too apparently ſuggeſts, when he tells us, <hi>Moral Good and Evil, is only the conformity or diſagreement of our Voluntary
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:135106:128"/>Actions to ſome Law; whereby Good and Evil, is drawn on us from the Will and Power of the Law-maker. Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 28. <hi>§.</hi> 5. If this definition is deſigned thus far, certainly the beſt Argument againſt ſuch a poſition is one by this Author advanced on another Occaſion. He Labours to prove, that the fouleſt Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, have obtained in whole Nations and Societies of Men, upon a Law of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, Opinion or Reputation; but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the conformity of an Action, to ſuch a Law, can by no Means give it the Character or Denomination of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Good. This muſt indeed deſtroy all real Diſtinction between Good and Evil, and render the moral endowments of the Mind, as Arbitrary and Precarious as the outward Dreſs of the Body. It's true an Action performed by a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Agent in Confomity to a Rule, is undoubtedly a Moral Action. But it does not hereby neceſſarily become a Moral Good, unleſs the Rule be good, or the Intrinſick matter of the Action be ſo: For without theſe Limitations it may be as much a Moral Evil, as if it interfered with an Eſtabliſhed Rule. So that I cannot but diſſent from Mr. <hi>Lock,</hi> when he places the Notion of Moral
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:135106:129"/>Good and Evil, in the conformity or diſagreement of a Voluntary Action to a Rule, tho' it be no more than a Rule or Law of Faſhion. I grant it Eſtabliſheth the Idea of a Moral Action; but a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Action is either good or bad, and therefore the Idea of Moral Goodneſs, cannot reſt upon the conformity of an Action to ſuch a Rule, but on the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick Goodneſs of the Action or Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ſuch a Rule.</p>

               <div n="3" type="section">
                  <p>§. 3. But to proceed; There are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who place the foundation of Moral Good, in the Conformity of Moral Actions, to our Rational Natures, as fitted for Society, and conſequently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion the degrees of Moral Good, as they ſerve more or leſs the ends of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. Indeed it cannot be denyed, but that the Great and Wiſe God, hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us a being, and Nature not only peculiarly framed for Society, but to be ſupported by it; and conſequently whatever accords with the Rational Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Man born to Society is undoubtly a Moral Good; but 'tis viſible Man in his Original Frame, bears a threefold Relation; to wit, Frame in Relation to God, his own Being, and that of his
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:135106:129"/>Neighbours; from whence ariſes a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Moral Good. Now the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Actions to our Rational Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as created for Society, may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent us with an Idea of thoſe Moral Goods, that reſpect our Being in it ſelf, or as it ſtands ſupported by Society, but it cannot give us an Idea of Moral Good, with reſpect to God our Creator, and conſequently this Notion cannot be an adequate meaſure of Moral Goodneſs.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="4" type="section">
                  <p>§. 4. Having ſaid thus much Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, it remains that we endeavour to State it in a poſitive way, or determine what is the true and adequate meaſure of Moral Goodneſs. And firſt, it's uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally allowed that Moral Good implies a Relation in the Nature of it. It's a good in reſpect of ſomething elſe, and conſequently there muſt be ſome fixed Standard, to examine and ſtate the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions it bears to it; and this Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard, may not improperly be called a meaſure of Moral Goodneſs. Again, Moral Good, which we are now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned with, reſpects the Actions of Men; and ſince the Actions of Men, with reſpect to a Threefold Relation, which we bear towards God, our own
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:135106:130"/>Beings and our fellow Creatures, paſs under three ſeveral Denominations, the meaſure of Moral Good, muſt extend to each of 'em. With Submiſſion, then I preſume the proper meaſure of Moral Good, muſt be taken from the Original Frame, Ends and Intereſts of our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; we are acted by invincible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſions, I mean thoſe of ſelf preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and deſire of happineſs, that will engage us to examine and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider 'em, and the experiment will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us with a meaſure, to determine the Goodneſs of all our actions, in our ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral intercourſes with God, our own Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or our fellow Creatures. It's cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain there can no action be truly Morally Good but what is conformable to our Original Frame, and the prime Ends and Intereſt of our Beings; and what is really thus conformable, is real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and truly Morally Good; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the Frame, Ends, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of our Being, muſt be a proper Standard of Moral Goodneſs. God has been graciouſly pleaſed, to give us a Being like himſelf, the great exemplar of all Perfection and Goodneſs, and he has annexed ſuch Ends and Intereſts to it, as will lay a Foundation for Actions,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:135106:130"/>that reſult from his bleſſed Nature; ſo that the whole line of Moral Duty is by the Laws of our Creation, made to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in Actions that are peculiarly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to our Natural Frame, in all its Capacities and Relations. The Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and Complexion of every duty, are taken from our ſelves, and by a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Efficiency, add Glory, Strength and Beauty to us; and therefore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be ſo true a meaſure of Moral Goodneſs, as the pure Frame, Ends, and Intereſts of our Beings. As for thoſe that place Moral Goodneſs, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of our Actions to a Law; it's certain that the Truth and Authority of this Law, where Revelation is wanting, muſt firſt be tryed by the Frame, Ends, and Intereſts of our Beings: Reaſon can make an eſtimate no other way; and conſequently all other meaſures of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Goodneſs, muſt at laſt reſolve into this.</p>

               </head>
               <p>FRom what has been laid down and Concluded, it's evident there's an unalterable diſtinction between Good and Evil. Now certainly whereinſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we fix the Notion of Moral Good, whether 'tis the imbracing of a Natural Good, by Rational motives and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions ariſing from the Intrinſick Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Thing, the proper Springs of a free Agent; or whether 'tis in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the Will and Authority of a Lawgiver, it's abundantly concluded, the Lines of Moral Good are fixed and unalterable: For it's manifeſt that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Good, always includes a Natural Good, and Natural Good is evidently Eſtabliſhed in the frame of Created Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and conſequently if the frame of Nature is unalterable, Moral Good muſt be ſo too. Nay, we may advance fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet; the great creator of all things, tho' in himſelf the moſt abſolute, and free Agent, yet was governed by the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:135106:131"/>dictates of his own Infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs, and conſequently the whole frame of created Nature is Eſtabliſhed according to the model of the divine perfections. If therefore Natural Good neceſſarily reſults from the Natural frame of Things; and their ſubſerviency and agreements with each other, and Moral Good neceſſarily includes a Natural Good in it, Moral as well as Natural Goodneſs, is as unalterable as the divine Perfections; and conſequently is in the higheſt ſence eternal, and unalterable. From hence we way obſerve how mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrouſly abſurd is that poſition advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by a ſet of Men, who firſt outlived all Moral Good, before they thought of the Notion, that there's no diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction between Good and Evil; that all the Impreſſions of the Mind, are to be reſolved into mere Habits Eſtabliſhed in Example, or Education, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Good and Evil of all Actions beſides that which reſults from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of poſitive Laws, whether Humane or Divine, is nothing elſe but a Law of Faſhion or Opinion. It's abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly concluded, God has given us a peculiar Frame, and thereby Eſtabliſhed certain Ends, and Intereſts ſuitable to it:
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:135106:132"/>And conſequently what really accords with the true Ends, and Intereſts of our Being, is that we call a Natural Good, and what directly claſhes and interſeres with them, is a Natural Evil. It's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded God has endued us with powers and faculties that, if duely exerted, will diſcover to us the true Frame, Ends and Intereſts of our Natures, and how all external things affect 'em, and are more or leſs Subſervient to 'em; and after this he has endued us with a power, to chuſe and purſue what is truly Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to theſe ends. The very frame and condition of our Natures, as they are to be ſupported with outward ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours and conveniencies, and the ſenſe of pleaſure and pain ſtampt upon our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the deſire of the one, and ſatisfaction in enjoying it; and the dread of the other, and the uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in ſuffering it, are proper and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Springs to ſet all our natural Powers on work, and fix 'em on their proper Ends and Objects; and all this proves a moral Capacity, to purſue and embrace that which we call <hi>Moral Good,</hi> and unleſs our Natural Powers and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties are regulated by the Laws and Principles of natural Good, it's impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:135106:132"/>the Action ſhould obtain the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of moral Good. It muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that the biaſs of <hi>Animal</hi> ſenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or pleaſures, is ſo impetuous in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted nature, that it often hurries us on to the purſuit of every thing that ſtrikes a preſent Reliſh, without conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering whether it accords with the true Ends and Intereſts of our Beings, at leaſt in that meaſure or manner we ſeek to enjoy them. Again, it's poſſible the Mind, by force of Habit, as well as power of Education, and the Faſhion of a Country, may be ſunk ſo deep into Carnality, and ſo tinged with brutal Enjoyments, as to be not only diſabled from making the leaſt Enquiry into the true Ends and Intereſts of its Being, but to receive an undiſturbed Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the practice of 'em, ſo that they may appear as natural as the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated Acts of Morality, yet this does by no means deſtroy the Foundations of moral Good; for it is nothing elſe but a kind of Spiritual Diſeaſe, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently we may as well ſay there was originally no true Foundations for Health, becauſe the Body is over-run with a Diſeaſe, as deny the Foundations of Morality, becauſe our Native Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities

HAving offered thus much upon the Nature and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Moral Goodneſs, I cannot diſmiſs the Argument without beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a few Remarks on the Author of the Eſſay, concerning <hi>Humane Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi> upon his advancing a Law of Faſhion, or Opinion, among the Rules, or Meaſures, of Moral Goodneſs. I ſhall not conceal what he has ſaid in Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of himſelf againſt Mr. <hi>Lowde,</hi> [<hi>See his Ep. to the Reader</hi> Ed. 2.] <hi>I was there not laying down Moral Rules, but ſhewing the Original and Nature of Moral Ideas, and enumerating the Rules Men make uſe of in Moral Relations, whether thoſe Rules were true or falſe.</hi> Now certainly tho' the principal Deſign of this Chapter might be what this Author expreſſes; yet an Impartial Reader could not have believed but there was
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:135106:133"/>a profeſſed Deſign too, to repreſent the true rules, or meaſures, of Moral Good, had he not expreſly declared the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. And for all this, I think a man muſt have a great deal of Charity to alter his Belief, notwithſtanding this extorted Declaration. And to juſtify my Opinion, I ſhall appeal to that very Section which he refers to for his Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication [<hi>Sect.</hi> 4. <hi>Chap.</hi> 28. <hi>B.</hi> 2.] ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Moral Duties, or Actions, <hi>viz.</hi> Gratitude, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he concludes, <hi>It is not enough to have clear and diſtinct Ideas of them, and to know what Names belong to ſuch and ſuch Combinations of Ideas, as make up the complex Idea belonging to ſuch a Name, we have a further and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Concernment, and that is to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch Actions ſo made up are morally Good, or Bad.</hi> Now, truly if the great concernment be to know or diſcover whether certain Actions are Morally Good or Bad, the true Nature of Moral Good muſt be fixed; for if it be not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, whether the <hi>Rule or Meaſure be true or falſe;</hi> I would fain know what Light we have given of Moral Good, or how we ſhall judge whether any particular action <hi>is Morally Good or Bad.</hi> Thus far there's a deſign to ſix the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:135106:134"/>of Moral Goodneſs, and we are the more induced to believe it, becauſe the very next Section preſents us with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed deſcription of <hi>Morally Good and Evil,</hi> purſuant <hi>to the deſcription he</hi> had before given of Good and Evil. <hi>Morally Good and Evil then is</hi> only <hi>the Conformity or Diſagreement of our Voluntary Actions to</hi> ſome <hi>Law; whereby Good and Evil is drawn upon us, from the Will and Power of the Law-maker.</hi> Here's a ſtanding defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of Moral Good and Evil, and this Author muſt own that a definition of Things, (ſuch as Good and Evil) is a diſcovery of the preciſe Nature of 'em, as they are in themſelves, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently it muſt imply a diſcovery of the true meaſures <hi>of Morally Good and Bad.</hi> To proceed then, the Nature of Morally Good and Bad, is here made to conſiſt in the conformity of Voluntary Actions to ſome Law, and therefore it's requiſite an Account ſhould be given of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rules or Laws of Moral Goodneſs, whereby we may view it in its ſeveral Species or kinds. This Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms in the Section immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. <hi>Of theſe Moral Rules and Laws to which Men generally Refer, and by which they judge of the Rectitude or Pravity of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:135106:134"/>their Actions there, ſeems to me to be three ſorts,</hi> with their different Enforcements or Rewards and Puniſhments, ſo that we ſee he induſtriouſly repreſents 'em in all the formalities of Laws, and gives 'em their proper and peculiar Sanctions, that they may obtain the Authority and Character of Laws. Upon this, he proceeds to eſtabliſh the ſeveral Species of Moral Good; and having enlarged very much upon the third Species of Moral Good, that of Virtue and Vice, he gives us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand his Intentions by the very Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of his Thirteenth Section. <hi>Theſe three Laws are Rules of Moral Good and Evil,</hi> and Sect 14. he expreſly tells us, <hi>That by taking the Rule from the Faſhion of the Country, the Mind hath a notion of Moral Goodneſs or Evil, which is the conformity, or not conformity, of any acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that Rule.</hi> Now what is all this, but to deſcribe the real Nature of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Goodneſs in its true meaſures, as well as kinds. It's evident, it was the Buſineſs of <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. and the reſt Branches from it by the Laws of method and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; nay, it's expreſſed in the very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, <hi>Sect.</hi> 14. and therefore we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not (without robbing Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> of the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:135106:135"/>Character he has juſtly merited of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Maſter of Reaſon) but conclude, that all this was in purſuance to his <hi>Great Concernment,</hi> Sect. 4. <hi>That is, to know whether ſuch actions ſo made up, are morally Good or Bad.</hi> But further to take off all this, Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> appeals to <hi>Sect.</hi> 15.20. Whereas the latter only affirms, that we have a notion of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Relation, whether the Rule be true or falſe; and this I think no body can deny, but yet I hope I have proved, that the notion of all Moral Goodneſs, depends on the truth of the Rule, not on the conformity of an Action, to a Rule, whether true or falſe. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer affirms, that the Idea, or Notion, of Moral Goodneſs, ariſes from the conformity of an Action to one of his three Rules, but I hope, I have proved that they only repreſent the Idea of a Moral Action, not of Moral Goodneſs, which indiſpenſibly requires the truth and goodneſs of the Rule. Laſtly, in vindication of himſelf, he produces his own Authorities for the eternal and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable nature of Virtue, by fixing it in the Will or Commands of God, <hi>Book</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. and 18. But yet we were at a loſs, to know whether

Chap. 28. Sect. 8. If the Commands or Will of God are only thoſe we receive from Revelation, or the poſitive Will of God (the firſt Edition of this Eſſay, ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting nothing to the contrary) then Moral Good and evil Antecedent to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, is not Eternal and Unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but may be founded on a Law of faſhion, as a true meaſure of Moral Good; for as this Author obſerves, the natural conveniences, and inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of things themſelves, may deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our choices, without making 'em the inviolable Rules of Practice. <hi>See Sect.</hi> 6. <hi>Book</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. and <hi>Sect.</hi> 6.2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 28.

                  <p>§. 2. Having ſaid thus much, give me leave to offer ſomething concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the neceſſity of advancing ſuch a Law. Now certainly, in order to the Deſcription of Moral Goodneſs, or the ſeveral Branches of it, there's not the leaſt neceſſity, for bringing a Law of Faſhion into the Liſt. I hope, I may
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:135106:136"/>without Arrogance or Preſumption, conclude from what has been already offered, that Moral Goodneſs is indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putably founded on the Truth or Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Rule, or the intrinſick Goodneſs of the things themſelves; and that neither the Sentiments or Opinions of Men, nor the Faſhion of a Country without theſe Requiſites, can give 'em ſo much as the bare Denominations of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Goodneſs; and therefore that a Law of Faſhion, ſhould be advanced as a Rule, to repreſent the Nature of Moral Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, can never be fairly accounted for. It's certain the Law of Nature, or at leaſt the Law of Revelation in conjunction with it, is the only meaſure of Moral Goodneſs: Inſomuch, that a Law of Faſhion interfering with one or both of 'em, is not only deſtitute of every grain of Moral Goodneſs, but cannot can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel one grain of ſin or guilt, when fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in oppoſition to either. This is the caſe of Duels, or any other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhionable Enormities; for Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as well as revealed Laws, when duly promulged, are juſtly preſumed to be the known fundamental Rules of Humane Actions, and the faſhion or publick reputation of an Action, can
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:135106:137"/>add nothing towards its innocence. And therefore what neceſſity is there for inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Law of Faſhion among the Rules or Meaſures of Moral Goodneſs, unleſs it were deſigned to eſtabliſh ſomething of Credit or Authority to it; things no ſooner ſuggeſted, than embraced in an Age of Liberty; and therefore this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſhould no ſooner have mentioned ſuch a Rule, than repreſented the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantableneſs of it. In a word, this Author might have conſidered, that he had given the groſſeſt immortalities, the Authority of Laws of Faſhion, and conſequently, that ſuch Laws are very unfit repreſentatives of the Ideas of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Goodneſs, certainly it had been as allowable, and neceſſary, to have brought an avowed Immorality into the Liſt, given it the Character and Authority of a Law, and pronounced it <hi>a meaſure of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, or Moral Rectitude, or Goodneſs; or at leaſt a Branch of it.</hi> But truly, this is a method that rather confounds, than eſtabliſhes the Ideas of Moral Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or inſtructs us <hi>to know whether ſuch Actions ſo made up, are morally Good or Bad.</hi> Indeed, had he condeſcended to an old Diſtinction of Good and Evil, and pronounced Moral Good or Evil,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:135106:137"/>either apparent or real, and Vertue and Vice reputed or real, then he had put himſelf under a neceſſity of enlarging very plentifully upon a Law of Faſhion, and abundantly freed himſelf from Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Reflection, eſpecially, upon an expreſs Declaration of the unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of ſuch a Law, when deſtitute of real intrinſick Goodneſs or Innocence; but till this is done, I hope, 'tis no crime to pronounce Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s Law of Faſhion (as it now ſtands Recorded) both dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and unneceſſary.</p>

But further, beſides the danger and frivolouſneſs of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, this Author ſeems to have groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſ-repreſented the old received No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Virtue and Vice, brought diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace upon the Ancient Moraliſts or Philoſophers, and eſtabliſhed a Law upon ſanctions peculiar to it, that were never eſteemed ſo. And firſt, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied, but that Cuſtom and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample have always been very prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Arguments, to influence the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as well as practice of Mankind, and when Practice is not only univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, but purſued, abetted, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by Authority, it will preſently
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:135106:138"/>be received into the judgments of Men, as an indiſputable Rule of Action, and when 'tis thus received, it becomes a Law or Rule of Action, and thus Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom and Example accidentally contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the eſtabliſhing a Rule, as they gradually new model the Judgment, and ſerve to create a real perſwaſion of the intrinſick goodneſs of any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Action; but yet I can ſcarce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Cuſtom, publick Reputation, or the Faſhion of a Countrey, were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver aſſigned by the intelligent part of Mankind, for the meaſure of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitude of a Rule, much leſs for a true and proper Rule of Action; no, an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Intrinſick Rectitude of things has been ingendered by Habit or Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, and the faſhionable practices of an Age, and then the Action has been purſued and embraced with as much Heat and Eagerneſs, as if it were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with an Intrinſick Goodneſs, and were to be ranked under the Title of Moral Goodneſs. And therefore, this Author, has offered Violence to the notions of Mankind, and particularly of the Ancient Moraliſts and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, in pronouncing the Faſhion of a Countrey to be a Law, and founding
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:135106:138"/>Virtue and Vice upon it. For firſt it can be no Law on this Author's own principles, ſince it wants a peculiar Sanction to enforce it. It's well known, Praiſe, Honour, or Reputation, is by no means peculiar to a Law of Faſhion, for 'tis the reward that attends all ſorts of Moral Goodneſs, or a Collateral Motive contrived by divine deſignation to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the practice of it. 2dly, Vertue and Vice among the Learned, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver meaſured by the Reputation it bears in the World, but by an Intrinſick Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rectitude. This I could evince were it neceſſary, from the whole tribe of Heathen Moraliſts, who always fixed the Notion in its Agreements, with the dictates of right Reaſon, and the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Frame, Ends, and Intereſts of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. I ſhall at this time content my ſelf with ſome Authorities, from that Learned Moraliſt he has cited to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his own Opinion. Thus he agrees to theſe great Truths in a Multitude of paſſages: <hi>Virtutis hoc proprium, earum rerum quae ſecundum Naturam ſunt, habere delectum.</hi> Lib. 3. <hi>de Fin.</hi> Sect. 4. <hi>Quaeſita enim vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus eſt, non quae relinqueret naturam, ſed quae tueretur,</hi> Ib. Lib. 4. §. 15. <hi>In homine Summa omnis Animi eſt, &amp; in Animo Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:135106:139"/>ex qua virtus eſt, quae Rationis Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutio definitur.</hi> Ib. Lib. 5. §. 14. <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus eadem in homine ac Deo eſt,—eſt autem Virtus nihil aliud quam perfecta &amp; ad Summum perducta natura; eſt igitur ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini cum Deo ſimilitudo.</hi> Lib. <hi>de Leg.</hi> §. 8. So that Vertue was never eſteemed that precarious Thing this Author has Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted; the publick Reputation of any Action was never the meaſure of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, but Right Reaſon, and the Frame, Ends and Intereſts of our Beings, elſe it's impoſſible Vertue in Men, ſhould be the ſame with Vertue in God, and Men to reſemble God in it, as this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor excellently expreſſes himſelf.</p>
                  <p>From all this it's manifeſt, that Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue was rather eſteemed the Standard or Meaſure of Praiſe, than Praiſe of Vertue, and that Honour or Praiſe, was never extolled or appealed to, but as it is the Product of Vertue, and a kind of reward to it. Thus much this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor could not be Ignorant of, when the Moraliſt explains the very paſſage he has cited almoſt with the ſame Breath; and makes it a deſcription of the chiefeſt Humane Good, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in Vertue or is attained by it. <hi>Quod ipſum ſit optandum per ſe, à Virtute
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:135106:139"/>profectum vel in ipſâ virtute ſitum, ſuâ ſponte laudabile.</hi> Tuſc. <hi>Quaeſt.</hi> lib. 2. §. 20. If this will not content him, I ſhall refer him to another paſſage that ſpeaks out what I have already aſſerted, and will inſtruct him that Vertue is the Meaſure of Praiſe, not Praiſe of Vertue. <hi>Omnis honos, omnis admiratio, omne ſtudium ad virtutem, &amp; ad eas actiones quae virtuti ſunt conſentaneae, refertur: Eaque omnia quae aut ita in animis ſunt, aut ita gerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, uno nomine honeſta dicuntur.</hi> Lib. 5 <hi>de Fin.</hi> §. 21. This, if I miſtake not, is to define Honour by Vertue, not Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue by Honour or Reputation, as Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> would have it. Upon the whole then I preſume, it appears that this Law of Opinion, has no more foundation in the received principles of Morality, than there's neceſſity for the invention; that it practiſes as much injuſtice, upon the ancient Advocates for Morality, as it diſcovers Impertinence or Evil deſign in the Author, and in a Word, it's ſo miſerably deſtitute of Solid Argument, or Principle to ſupport it, that nothing but the faſhionable Immoralities of a degenerate Age, can aſſert its truth or Authority.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVI. <hi>Of the Nature of Conſcience in General.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Shall not much enlarge on the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Conſcience, which imports the knowledge of the Line of Duty, and a directing Power or Faculty, to conſider the Nature of thoſe Actions we are about to execute, by applying 'em to the Line of Duty. This is a truth ſo well known, that no one can diſpute it, that allows the uſe of Reaſon, or make us creatures that can act by a Law, or are capable of being Governed by it. The principal enquiry then is concerning Conſcience with reſpect to paſt Actions: And firſt it's a truth, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, univerſally agreed upon, that Man is endued with a Power of Retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and reflecting on his own actions; The retentive Faculty is abundantly maintained upon the Power of Memory, and the Power of Reflection is founded in the very Power of Reaſon. For to Reflect and Animadvert upon our thoughts, is undoubtedly an Act of Reaſon, and Thought. And therefore
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:135106:140"/>as Man acts upon Thought, Deliberation, and Argument, he cannot but be conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that he thinks, deliberates, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, and conſequently that he acts pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuant to it. Indeed, I preſume, to think, deliberate, and Act, and to conſider or know that we think, deliberate, or act thus and thus, are two diſtinct acts of the Mind; but whether we think, and deliberate, and reflect upon our Thoughts in the ſame, or different Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is no way prejudicial to the Doctrine of Conſciouſneſs. To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed then as we can reflect, ſo we can animadvert upon the nature of paſt Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for thoſe very faculties that enable us to deliberate, and judge of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of an Action, before it is executed, will enable us to paſs as clear, if not much better judgment upon it, after 'tis over: For then we view it in all its Aſpects, Circumſtantials, and Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages. Now certainly Conſcience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains both theſe Powers in it; I mean a Power of Recollecting and a Power of Animadverting on the Nature of our paſt Actions; for without ſuch inſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Powers, it's impoſſible there can be any ſuch thing as Conſcience. But then that which gives us the principal and
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:135106:141"/>formal Notion of Conſcience, is a Power of trying the Nature of our Actions, by ſome Law or Rule of Action. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Nature of Moral Good and Evil may be; I mean whether it conſiſts in the conformity of our Actions to a Law or Rule, or their diſagreement from it, certain I am the Acts or Powers of Conſcience imply the examination of an Action with reference to a Law or indiſpenſable Rule of Action; whereby it carries the appearance of a Duty or not a Duty. For Conſcience undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly implies a Condemning and abſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faculty in it, and theſe are exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed with reſpect to Duty, and Duty ariſes from the Obligation of a Law: So that Conſcience is undoubtedly the meaſure of our Actions by a Law. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, this is ſo much the formal No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Conſcience, that it runs thro' all the inſtances, and exercitations of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences; for they are no otherwiſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed than by the different Laws that Regulate them, as from a Law of Nature, Law of Revelation, or Civil Polity. But then in order to the paſſing an Abſolution or Cenſure on our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and our ſelves for them by a Rule, there muſt be a Power of Acting Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:135106:141"/>to this Law or Rule; for without this, the Action with its Effects and Conſequences, cannot be imputed to us. This is implyed in the very notion of a Law, being a Rule propoſed to Rational Creatures that have a Power to Act, or not Act on Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Motives, and Convictions; ſo that Conſcience contains a great many different movements, or workings in it. <hi>Firſt,</hi> A Power of Retaining. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> A Power of Animadverting, or Reflecting on paſt Actions. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A Power of applying, and comparing them with a Law or Rule. <hi>Fourthly.</hi> A Power of diſcerning the Truth, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or Equity of the Rule, <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The Obligation and Authority of it; and <hi>Laſtly,</hi> A Power of aſcribing the Action to our ſelves, by acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Power of Acting in Conformity to this Rule; whereby the Good, or Evil, Guilt or Merit of the Action may be ſome way imputed to us. So that Conſcience may be juſtly defined to be the Judgment we paſs upon our own Actions, whether paſt, or preſent, as ſcanned and meaſured by a Law, But now, tho' a Law in general is aſſigned for the meaſure of Conſcience, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:135106:142"/>be imagined that every thing we fanſie, or are pleaſed to aſſign for the mark, or ſcope of our Actions, muſt paſs for the true Law, or Meaſure of Conſcience. It's certain, Cuſtom, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, Example, or the Reputation of an Action gained by Numbers, and a Looſe, Degenerous Age, cannot be a Law, or Meaſure of Conſcience. No, the Paſſions, Prejudices, or By-inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of particular Perſons, the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Fears, Enthuſiaſm, or Diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Suggeſtions of too many, may as well challenge the Character of Laws, as any that have yet been mentioned. But to determine this matter in a few words. If we enquire into the true meaſure of Conſcience, according to its Original Frame; it's certain, the Law of God, whether Natural, or Reveal'd, is to be eſteemed the only proper mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. For none but a Sovereign Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor can be the Lord of Conſcience, all other Powers, and Authorities, being only ſpecial Deputations from him; and that Duty, and Obligation that reſults from their Laws, reſt upon a Divine Deputation that gives being to their Character, as well as Authority.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THE Nature of Conſcience being thus ſtated, I cannot but reflect a little on Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s Account of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, when he tells us, <hi>That it is nothing elſe but our own Opinion of our own Actions, and this Opinion ſounded in a Perſwaſion, however got, as from Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Company, or the Cuſtoms of a Country. See Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>§.</hi> 8. This, to ſpeak the leaſt, I think, is a very looſe, and imperfect Definition of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. And to ſay, <hi>'Tis nothing elſe but an Opinion however got;</hi> ſeems to Suggeſt, as if God had Inſtituted no fixed Rule of Conſcience, but that it is to be reſolved into little elſe but Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, Company, and Education. In a word, it's a Deſcription calculated, purely for an Erroneous Conſcience, that has no other Foundation but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Convictions, whether true or falſe. I will not deny, but that an erroneous,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:135106:143"/>vitiated Conſcience, is in a large ſence, ſtiled Conſcience, and that Cuſtom, or Education may give being to ſuch a Conſcience; but then it's in Scripture diſtinguiſhed by the Denominations of <hi>a weak,</hi> or <hi>defiled Conſcience.</hi> I will grant, that it is a meaſure of Action to thoſe that labour under it; becauſe, as God has formed us Reaſonable Creatures, we are to Act upon Rational Motives, and Convictions. He has given us no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meaſure of Action as Men, and therefore the preſent Light, or Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions we are under, are the immediate Springs, and Principles of Action: for to Act Blindfold, or without Reaſon, or in contradiction to it, muſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the Frame of our Beings, and the Practice of all Moral Vertue. But yet God has ſet a ſufficient mark upon an erroneous Conſcience, by charging Sin on the Error, where-ever a Man can be charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Neglect as to the means of Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. On this Account St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us, that the <hi>impure,</hi> or thoſe that are under an erroneous Conſcience, are <hi>Polluted as well in Mind, as Conſcience. Tit.</hi> 1, 15. So that an erroneous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience being never a direct Rule, at leaſt not any of God's Forming; nay,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:135106:143"/>being a Rule occaſioned by our ſelves, that enhances our Guilt, rather than Merit; it is not but in a very improper and extended Sence to paſs under the Denomination of Conſcience, at leaſt, without ſome diſtinguiſhing Characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtick annexed, that the Divine Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of Conſcience may not ſuffer by it. I am ſure it is Conſcience founded on the true Law, or Rule of Conſcience, according to the Divine Eſtabliſhment of it, that this Author ſhould have Animadverted on, as a proof of Innate Ideas, not a Fictitious Conſcience: And certainly it is a very imperfect account of ſuch a Conſcience, to affirm, that in the true, and proper Sence of it, it is nothing but our own Opinion of our own Actions, tho got by Cuſtom, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, or Education; certainly the Foundation of Conſcience ought not to have been omitted, which ariſes from the Conformity of our Actions to the proper Rule, or Law of Conſcience, the Law of God.</p>

               <p>HAving offered thus much concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Nature of Conſcience, we may eaſily repreſent the Foundation, and Authority of natural Conſcience. By Natural Conſcience, I mean a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience that exerts it ſelf in a State of Nature antecedent to a State of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. And certainly there's a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience Eſtabliſhed by God upon an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable Foundation, even in this State. For it's already concluded, that Man in his Original Frame is capable of Acting by certain Eſtabliſhed Rules; It's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that theſe Rules are diſcovered to him, as the ſpecial Inſtitution of God, binding them upon him as his proper Laws, and indiſpenſible Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Action; It's concluded, that God has Created him with a Power of applying all his Actions to a Rule, and a Power of Judging whether his Actions accord with, or deviate from this Rule,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:135106:144"/>and a Power of adjudging himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to God, for the violation of this Rule, and conſequently a neceſſity of acquitting or condemning himſelf by this Rule. In a Word, it's concluded that theſe Rules are eternal, and unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable, being founded in the Original Frame, Ends and Intereſts of Created Nature; therefore ſince theſe are Truths eſtabliſhed upon the cleareſt Evidence, and Convictions, there's a natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience reſulting from the Frame of our Beings, and founded upon the moſt uniform, and unalterable Meaſures and Principles. It's viſible God has framed us as exquiſitely apprehenſive of the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Line of Duty, and of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accountable to him for it, as ſenſible of Torment and Miſery; So that the workings of Conſcience can never be deſtroyed; they will unavoidably break in upon us at one time or other, and fill us with Horror and Confuſion. Tho' it cannot be denied, but that Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, and Cuſtom may engender a falſe Light, or Senſe of Things; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a falſe conſcience, either by miſtaking the Nature, and Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Actions, or the Rules of 'em; by making a falſe application, or a falſe
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:135106:145"/>Rule; yet it's concluded there's a Conſcience Eſtabliſhed in the Original Frame or Nature of Things, and tho' it may for ſome time be ſuppreſſed or ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled, yet we can never ſecure it from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning upon us.</p>

               <p>NOw certainly if what has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready aſſerted carries force and evidence in it, there needs nothing more to diſcover the falſehood, not to ſay Senſeleſs Impudence of a prevailing poſition, That <hi>Conſcience is nothing elſe but certain Superſtitious Fears, contracted and rivetted by the Power of Education;</hi> for it's viſible the Laws of Conſcience are an Inſtitution of God himſelf, as certain and unalterable, as the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Good and Evil; nay as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and unalterable, as the Frame, and Order of Nature. It's true there is one
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:135106:145"/>thing which the Libertine may retreat to, to blaſt or diſparage the Truth and Reality of Conſcience. I mean the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtence and contradiction of Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous vitiated Conſciences. For ſince Conſcience ſometimes as viſibly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers it ſelf in the eſpouſal and defence of open Immoralities, as the ſtricteſt vertues; and of palpable Falſhoods and Errors, as the cleareſt Truths; it's with ſome colour concluded that Conſcience is only the Effects of Habit, Cuſtom and Education, Working the Mind up to certain Superſtitious Sentiments and Opinions. But certainly the miſtake is obvious, for this is an Argument that in reality proves no more, than that the mind is capable of receiving falſe Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Things, and eſpouſing 'em as real Truths and unqueſtionable Rules of Action. If this be admitted there's no neceſſity for diſcarding the Divine Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy or Inſtitution of Natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, unleſs we muſt deny or reject every Divine Ordinance, becauſe it was not eſtabliſhed above the Poſſibility of violence, or diſtortion. It may eaſily be granted that the Mind or Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may be warped, or moulded to the reception of very abſurd Opinions and
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:135106:146"/>Notions; there are a great many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring cauſes that conſpire to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting ſuch habits; there are vitious appetites and propenſions that carry a fatal biaſs over all our Motions or Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; there are examples and the faſhion of an Age, which (once falling in with Native vitious propenſions) will turn the Scale againſt the cleareſt Arguments and Convictions; ſo as to enforce a Practice contrary to received Sentiments and Opinions; and Practice engenders into habit, and at the ſame time Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſheth a Powerful Familiarity; and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity takes off the unnaturalneſs or incongruity of Things, and by tract of time repreſents 'em to the Mind, as highly agreeable and innocent; ſo that it's poſſible a cultivated mind may be totally Debauched and Corrupted, that a pure Conſcience may become defiled, and a regulated judgment perverted: The Force of habit may reconcile con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions; the exorbitance of Luſts may ſend forth ſuch Vapours as will ſuffocate not only the natural but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved light of the underſtanding: But the caſe of uncultivated Nations is highly convincing, where enormities become the Subject of Education, and
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:135106:146"/>are infuſed as Rules of Action from the very firſt dawnings of Reaſon. Native luſt, and irregular appetites may do much to cramp and fetter the Mind, or Reaſon, to that degree as to ſuppreſs all Solemn enquiries into the nature of Things; and conſequently oblige her to determine according to the Suggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Impulſe of ſenſe; but when vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious propenſions, and parental in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions are mixed and twiſted in with each other, and a People neither ſee nor hear of any thing but the depravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Nature, no wonder if a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Conſcience purſuant to it is eſtabliſhed (at leaſt while Luſt keeps the Aſcendant) and that too as reſolute and inflexible, as the moſt pure and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated Conſcience. I muſt confeſs it's a received Maxim among the Schools, that in Actions that are <hi>de primo dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine naturae,</hi> the Conſcience cannot err, but is always correct and regular, and on this account it was pronounced <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitus naturalis &amp; innatus.</hi> But I can diſcover no juſt foundation for this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, eſpecially ſince Scripture, as well as Experience, ſeems to warrant the contrary; for St. <hi>Paul</hi> dictates no leſs, when he deſcribes the ſtate of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:135106:147"/>Heathen World, <hi>Having the Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding darkned, being alienated from the Life of God thro' the Ignorance that is in them, becauſe of the blindneſs of their heart, who being paſt feeling have given 'emſelves over to work all uncleanneſs with greedineſs.</hi> But now after all this, tho' the Original Laws of Conſcience may be thus ſhamefully ſubſerted, and a falſe Conſcience frequently erected in the room of that which God has inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, yet it is abundantly demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it reſts upon immutable foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. There's a Conſcience which has neither Cuſtom, nor Education, for its Creator, but that God that made the Heavens; it's founded in the immutable counſels of infinite Wiſdom, and has the ſame frame and eſtabliſhment with Nature it ſelf. Let the <hi>Latitudinarian</hi> conſider this, and every mouth ſhall be ſtopped. Let him conſider, that as 'tis perfect demonſtration that God has e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed an unalterable Oeconomy of Conſcience, ſo he'll be infinitely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to aſſert the Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of it; and tho' the exorbitance of his Luſts have bribed his Judgment, and buoyed him up into a Perſwaſion, that Conſcience is a mere <hi>Chimora,</hi> or State,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:135106:147"/>or Church-Engine, to reduce the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to a ſervile Obedience; and, in a word, tho' the Power and Authority of this perſwaſion has carried him on to the moſt execrable Impieties without reluctancy, or remorſe; yet he may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure himſelf that the Divine Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Conſcience will one day be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, and tho' want of means of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation (where there's room for a juſt Plea of this nature) may ſilence the loud cries of it, yet he may aſſure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf it will exert in proportion to every neglect of means with all imaginable vigour and fury, upon every unrepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Sinner, and then he'll find thoſe ſuperſtitious empty Fears will prove real Accuſations, to condemn him to an irrevocable ſtate of Miſery.</p>

               </head>
               <p>HAving thus diſcovered the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Oeconomy of Natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, it gives us an opportunity to account for thoſe Inſults, thoſe Gripes, and Convulſions it makes upon the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute at the approach of death, or in time of Sickneſs. I'm ſenſible that in endeavouring to aſſert a deſpiſed No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that has been often reſolved into a mere dejection of Spirits, an <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriacal flatus,</hi> or certain ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unreaſonable fears impreſſed by the force of education. Theſe are indeed very plauſible colours and ſuggeſtions, to a mind that is ſteeped and impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with the over-flowings of Luſt. But before this opinion can obtain cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and admiſſion, the Authors of it are indiſpenſibly obliged to prove, that God has not Originally eſtabliſhed a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience upon certain unalterable mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:135106:148"/>and principles. But inſtead of this, it has already been ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated, that Conſcience hath the ſame Foundation, and Original with that of our Beings. It had its Birth, and Authority in the ſame Act, that made us reaſonable Creatures, and free Agents; and therefore if upon a review of paſt Actions; Remonſtrances ariſe by comparing 'em with a Rule that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers the true Ends and Intereſts of our Beings, all the reaſon in the World, will oblige us to conclude, that they are nothing but the returns of Natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. What tho' a contrary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience was Erected, acting upon the ſtrongeſt Perſwaſions, or Convictions, yet it muſt now be allowed, that it is founded in Violence, and conſequently the Mind is under a poſſibility of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to right notices, and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. And certainly the preſent caſe affords the higheſt probabilities for the truth of the ſuppoſition. For firſt it muſt be confeſſed whilſt Luſt and exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant Appetites maintain their Ground, a biaſſed Judgment at leaſt cannot eſcape being chained to their Intereſt, but theſe ſeem to depend upon the Health and Vigour of the Animal part. As
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:135106:149"/>this is ſhocked, or enervated, whether thro' Age or ſickneſs, ſo theſe muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline and ſuffer Diſgrace. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the hear of Luſt expires, ſo the Judgment or Underſtanding will in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion be diſcharged from her Fetters, ſhe will view things with a new aſpect, not thro' the Steams of Luſt, and as it were thro' a Glaſs darkly, but Face to Face, and in their naked Shapes and Features, and conſequently our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on paſt Actions will be form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon new Meaſures and Principles, ſhe'll be able to diſcern the true Ends and Intereſts of Humane Nature, and thereupon bring all her Actions to the Teſt of this Rule; and this cannot fail to beget new Perſwaſions and Convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, according to the primitive Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of Conſcience; ſo that it is not a fit of Melancholy, the effect of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pauperated Spirits, no otherwiſe than a an expiring Vapour is the cauſe of Light, which before it obſtructed; but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns of Natural Conſcience acted upon a right Baſis, and exerting it ſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that frame in which it was created. Thus much the <hi>Latitudinarian</hi> may diſcern from the Natural efficacy of Things. But beſides all this he may
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:135106:149"/>very well allow this wonderful change, to be in ſome meaſure compleated, by the concurrence of ſupernatural cauſes. If God upon a long train of unrelenting impiety, has at laſt conſigned a Man over to irretrievable deſtruction, I would fain know why he may not ſuffer the Devil, or ſome of his Spiritual Crew, to diſplay before his Mind a Scheme of his paſt Actions. No one can queſtion but that Order of Spirits can converſe with Spirits, or make their applications to a Spiritual Being, and conſequently that he can, if permitted, excite ſuch Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſuggeſt ſuch Ideas, as will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the moſt conſiderable minutes of our whole Lives, and enable us to bring 'em to a new Teſt, and view 'em in their proper Lineaments and proportions; and conſequently as they appear to claſh with the Line of Duty, plunge a Soul into the moſt direful Agonies and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions. This is but a kind of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of that future miſery, which I'm confident he will be the Inſtrument to enhance upon all Reprobate Sinners. But on the other hand, if the patience and long-ſuffering of God, extends to the leading a Soul to repentance, who can diſpute the Divine Influences of the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:135106:150"/>Holy Spirit, in bringing all paſt Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to our remembrance. He can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover ſuch minute circumſtances as will recover loſt Ideas. He can excite ſuch Meditations and Thoughts, as will ſuggeſt the true Rule of Action, and Line of Duty, and conſequently ſuch as will neceſſitate the Mind to paſs Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence on every Action purſuant to it. It's an Undiſputed Truth that the Holy Spirit can move and excite the Powers of the Soul by a ſpiritual kind of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, as effectually as the Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick and perſwaſives of fellow Creatures, that muſt be Tranſmitted by Sounds thro' material Organs and Vehicles. This is an Aſſertion ſo clear and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable, that I can ſee no reaſon why thoſe miniſtring Spirits, the bleſſed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels by the divine Appointment, may not be allowed capable of maintaining Intercourſes of this nature, even with this lower World, ſince it only places their Power upon a level with accurſed Spirits, who have on all hands a Power attributed to 'em, of influencing the Souls as well as Bodies of Men. And certainly God, whoſe infinite Knowledge and Wiſdom enables him to adapt all his divine Succours to ſutable Seaſons
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:135106:150"/>and Opportunities, could not exert 'em better, than when the Animal Part is diſabled by Age, Sickneſs, or other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Calamities. And certainly its high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreeable to the divine Wiſdom, when a Change of Mind and Conſcience is wrought, to give 'em a deep ſenſe of their Folly and Error, and conſequently to throw 'em into the ſevereſt Agonies and Convulſions, before he raiſes 'em up by his ſpecial Reſtoratives, the <hi>refreſhings of the Lord.</hi> And now certainly we have foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation enough to anſwer for the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of Conſcience, and at the ſame time aſſert the Divine Oeconomy of it. This is an Hypotheſis cannot be diſputed in a ſtate of Revelation: And tho' in a ſtate of Nature God has not covenanted to govern Mankind by ſpiritual Succours, or the Effuſions of his Holy Spirit on the hearts of Men, yet I do not find he has a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny where bound himſelf to the contrary; and its highly probable his infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Wiſdom may ſometime incline him to diſpenſe his Favours on this part of his Off-ſpring; and conſequently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the Eſtabliſhment of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon its true foundation, I mean according to the primitive Model and Oeconomy of it.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXI. <hi>Of the Evidence of future Rewards, and Puniſhments from the Preſages of Natural Conſcience.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THat Mankind was Originally Form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Created under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of a Law, and that Rewards, and Puniſhments are aſcertained to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance, or Violation of this Law, has already been proved beyond any juſt colour of Diſpute. That which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, is to fix the Stage where this great Scene ſhall be diſplayed, and a Formal Diſtribution Tranſacted. Now I am perſwaded it will be eaſily granted, that Rewards, and Puniſhments cannot well be Executed in this State of Life. For firſt, the Eſtabliſhed Coercive Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of this World can by no means pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to it; they can determine no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beyond the Surface, or External parts of the Action. And theſe muſt be handed to them upon the evidence of Senſes, the Authority of Circumſtances, and the Veracity of Men, and Sinners; ſo that very often, the Innocent is Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:135106:151"/>to Act his Part in Sufferings, in the room of the Guilty. By this means, the ſubſtantial parts of the Action lie Dormant, and eſcape the moſt ſubtle Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, and Cenſures of Mankind; ſo that there may be a Thouſand <hi>whited Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres, which indeed appear beautiful out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but are within full of dead Mens Bones, and of all uncleanneſs.</hi> But this is not all, for muſt we not admit a vaſt Scroul of Enormities, that the niceſt obſervations can never pretend to reach, or fathom; ſome that are ſheltered by Studied Retreats, and Privacies, others by paſſing no further than Thought, or Intention, and the inward Workings of the Mind, ſo that it's impoſſible that any thing leſs than an infinite Power, or <hi>a Searcher of Hearts and Reins,</hi> can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſtate the Deſervings of Men, and adjuſt an Allotment of Rewards and Puniſhments in proportion to them. Indeed, an All-wiſe Creator, that <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the very Thoughts long before,</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly qualified to finiſh his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of this kind, even in this Life. But yet in Crimes that are Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and Notorious, we ſometimes ſee the Authors paſs off the Stage of the World without any viſible Marks of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:135106:152"/>Vengeance, at leaſt, ſuch as we may Read from others. It's true, God may Reward, or Puniſh by ſecret ſteps or motions, and by a train of Cauſes; and Events; but yet theſe are Methods not ſo agreeable to the Deſigns of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Wiſdom, in Rewarding, or Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing in this World, for when they are diſpenſed at a diſtance, and after an inviſible manner, they cannot influence the Offender, or the Publick, becauſe, by this means, they cannot well be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved into the direct, and immediate cauſes of them; and conſequently, the great deſign of ſuch Diſpenſations is in a great meaſure loſt, or ſtifled. But now, ſince it is concluded, that the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation of Laws does not only infer a Right of Puniſhment, but that Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will infallibly follow upon the Violation of Laws; we may from hence further conclude, that there's another World aſſigned by God for a final, and ſtrict Diſtribution of Rewards, and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments. And certainly, ſince God is a God of Juſtice, and has, decreed Puniſhments, as well as Rewards; we muſt conclude, that his laſt Diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will be Acted upon the niceſt Rules of Juſtice, and conſequently proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:135106:152"/>according to the true Intrinſick Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of every Action, without Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, or Partiality, or the leaſt Reſpect of Perſons. Theſe are truths that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in direct, and eaſie conſequences, from the nature of the things themſelves. But then if we allow the Divine Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of Conſcience, it's impoſſible we can reject the evidence of them: That God ſhould Eſtabliſh a Regiſter of our Actions in the very Frame of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is an uncontroulable Argument, that he has Created us to ſome ſolemn Tribunal. Nay further, that God ſhould not only Create us with reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Powers and Faculties, whereby we keep a kind of Diary of paſt Actions, but implant certain abſolving, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning Powers upon them, whereby we are neceſſarily poſſeſſed with Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of Guilt, and Puniſhment, or Favour or Reward. It's a clear Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there will be a Tribunal erected, where theſe Divine Powers will diſplay, and exert themſelves to the utmoſt pitch of Activity. The <hi>Latitudinarian,</hi> may (if he pleaſes,) bring Diſgrace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, by reſolving them into Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Fears, and the Biaſs of Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but I'm perſwaded, it is unexcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:135106:153"/>proved there's the Finger of God in 'em. And therefore, we muſt conclude, that the Powers of Natural Conſcience are only a kind of Vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, or Subſtitute, that acts for a time by way of Reſtraint on the one hand, and Encouragement on the other, but at laſt, ſhe muſt give up all her Reports, and reſign to a Supreme Judicature, ſhe muſt as it were, <hi>deliver up the Kingdom unto God,</hi> and appear as a Witneſs, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than a Judge. Theſe are the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Conſequences, and Original De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and Uſes of ſuch Divine Powers, for unleſs theſe be admitted, it's impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible we ſhould account for them, as the Ordinances of an infinitely Wiſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. But further, that which moſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully demonſtrates a State of Future Rewards and Puniſhments, is the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of Conſcience towards the laſt Periods of Life. That the Powers of Conſcience ſhould awake, and grow Strong and Vigorous, when the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Powers grow Faint and Languid, that her Apprehenſions ſhould be clear, and Piercing, her Reſentments Rigid and Severe, and her Exultations full of Joy, and Conſolation, when the powers of Animal Nature are ſunk and waſted,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:135106:153"/>and ready to Expire, is an Infallible Demonſtration that we are Acted by a Principle highly diſtinct from Matter, from Fleſh, and Blood, or Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, or in a word, a Principle that will Live and Act after this Earthy Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle is diſſolved. Indeed, when we conſider that the Reflections of a well ſpent Life diſcover themſelves at the point of Death, when the Paſſions of the Animal Part are ſunk, and waſted, in the moſt grateful Applauſes, and ſubſtantial Satisfactions; ſo that the whole World, and all its Charms and Beauties, appear flat and empty before it, what can a reaſoning Mind conclude but that 'tis a Harbinger to ſome future Rewards. It implies a deep preſenſion of ſome future Bleſſings that ſhall be conferred upon us by a Sovereign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as a <hi>Recompence of that Labour of Love we have entertained for his Name's ſake.</hi> On the other hand, when we conſider thoſe inſupportable Gripes and Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, more bitter than the Pangs of Death, that are the fatal concluſion of a diſſolute, impenitent Life; when we conſider that the Tempeſt ariſes and grows loud and clamorous, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the decays of Nature, and tho'
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:135106:154"/>that cracks and groans and ſinks, yet this will not be appeaſed; we muſt conclude that there are convictions that, will be carried into another State, and not only torment, but impeach every impenitent Criminal, before ſome other Tribunal. Indeed, were there no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Rewards and Puniſhments, annexed to the violation or obſervance of Laws, or were there an exact diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution made in this World, or in a Word, were there no real diſcovery of a divine Oeconomy of Conſcience, then we muſt think of ſome other Method to diſpel the Vapour. But ſince theſe are proved upon the higheſt evidences and Demonſtrations, we muſt conclude that ſuch black preſages are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue to future Miſeries, to certain Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotments, that will be the Award of ſome future Reckoning. Theſe are E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences ſo clear and undenyable, that if the <hi>Latitudinarian</hi> will ſtill perſiſt, I'm confident his only conviction will be an actual perception of the Fruits of his diſſolute Life, and his Impregnable Infidelity.</p>

               </head>
               <p>NOw ſince it's abundantly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated that there's a divine Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of Conſcience, and that it reſts on the unalterable meaſures of moral Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or the original nature of things themſelves, we may with force of reaſon conclude, that our paſt Actions ſhall be chiefly tried by this Original Standard. It may indeed be objected, That no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Conſcience can be the meaſure of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Man's Condemnation but his own, nor upon any Actions than thoſe he was conſcious of when committed. The firſt part of the Objection is certainly an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controverted truth, for when God puts any man on his Tryal upon the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Conſcience, it muſt certainly be his own, and not another's Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but yet it's highly probable our Conſciences will not be ſuch as they were when enſlaved by vitious Habits and Diſpoſitions, but reformed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the divine Occonomy of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and conſequently the Original
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:135106:155"/>Standard of Conſcience will become our own, and appear as Evidence againſt us. It's highly evident from what has alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy been ſuggeſted, that the Conſciences of Men in another World will be fixed on a new bottom. It's highly probable that all the Minutes of every Action, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Natures and Reaſons of the Line of Duty, will be diſplayed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the view of the mind; ſo that there will not be only a new diſcovery of loſt Idea's, Thoughts and Actions; but of their incompatibility with the Line of Duty; nay, there will be a diſcovery of the Reaſons and Original of all Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages; the Mind will plainly diſcern the Error and Abſurdity of former Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; ſhe will confeſs that the violence and importunity of Luſt, or a habit of Thoughtleſneſs, or Inconſideration, was the true and genuine cauſe of 'em, and conſequently the frame and Oeconomy of Conſcience will not only be altered, according to the Intrinſick Nature of things, and received as every Man's own proper Conſcience, but it will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover Sin and Guilt in the erring Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and charge the miſchief of it upon its proper owner, where-ever the Errors appear to be contracted from
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:135106:155"/>the neglect of means of Information. For certainly as God has endued us with Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties to inſtruct us in the Line of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſo he has made us capable of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it in that Courſe and Order which he has eſtabliſhed, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of purſuing and embracing ſuch Means as are truly conducive to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of it; and therefore when pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Means are inſtituted or propoſed, or, as it were, lie before us in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon road of Thinking, the Miſchiefs, or iniquity of an Action, by the Laws of Conſcience, will be imputed to us, tho' it was committed with a perſwaſion of its Innocence, becauſe the Order of Nature, and the Laws of Humane Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are as much perverted by acting without the uſe of eſtabliſhed means, as contrary to inward Convictions; and tho' the Action in the preciſe nature of it is not willfully wicked, yet the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of Means may be juſtly eſteemed willfull, and conſequently the Effects and miſchiefs of the Action juſtly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted. I will not deny but there are thouſands of miſerable Wretches in the World under ſuch fatal Circumſtances, that they ſeem to be placed out of the reach of due Means of Information; but
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:135106:156"/>to judge preciſely of this ſeems to be a peculiar of the ſearcher of Hearts and Reins. However I am perſwaded the common Exigences and Neceſſities of Humane Nature will inſtruct Mankind in the moſt fundamental Rules of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Religion; and yet God will charge nothing upon us, but where he can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince our Conſcience of notorious Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glects; and in this caſe it's conſonant to the Rules of Juſtice, that Sentence ſhould be paſſed not according to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, but preſent Convictions. Indeed it can never be imagin'd, that the great Judge of all the Earth in his final Awards to Mankind, will erect a Tribunal that had not its Original from him, I mean from the Convictions of an erroneous Conſcience; and therefore ſince it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated that new Sentiments, and Convictions, will break in upon the Mind, even to the charging of Guilt upon thoſe Neglects which were the immediate ſource of falſe Convictions, we may juſtly conclude that the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Proceedings of the Great Day ſhall be eſtabliſhed upon a regulated Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; I mean, according to the Divine Oeconomy of it; and conſequently it is not the Plea of former Convictions, nor
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:135106:156"/>want of conſciouſneſs when Enormities were committed, that will be ſufficient to exempt any Man from the juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of it. For theſe may be reſolved into Perſonal Neglects, and Perſonal Neglects are alone ſufficient to derive a Guilt upon us. As for the want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs it's a branch of the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not yet replied to; and therefore I ſhall make ſome few Remarks upon it. And firſt, it's certain as long as Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities are committed upon perſonal Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glects, as in the caſe of Drunkenneſs, it is not neceſſary the Mind ſhould be conſcious of the whole proceſs, when ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually committed. It's abundantly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, if upon a repreſentation of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances we ſhall at laſt be forced to own them, or aſcribe the Commiſſion of 'em to our ſelves, for this will bring us under the dominion of Conſcience at the laſt day. Certainly we may with as much force of Reaſon plead an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from the guilt of Enormities, which thro' tract of time were wiped off the Table of the Mind, as deny to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for Enormities, which when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted we were not conſcious of, when it was ſome former Enormity had diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled us from being conſcious of 'em;
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:135106:157"/>whereas it can only be required in both caſes that proper, and competent Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods are contrived to make us conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous at the laſt day, ſo as to pronounce our ſelves the Authors of 'em; for when this is done, Conſcience will determine as effectually as if our preſent and paſt Convictions were conſonant to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Upon the whole then it's viſible, it is not the preſent ſtate of any Man's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, any farther than it accords with the Divine Oeconomy of Conſcience, no more than any preſent Act of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, that will be received for a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal meaſure of the Goodneſs or Evil of our Actions; and conſequently of a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Condemnation or Deliverance, but Conſcience founded on the expreſs Laws of God, the ſole Rule of Duty, and the Agreement or Diſagreement of our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions with them. I would not be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, as if I intended to ſtreighten, or fix Limits to the infinite Mercies of God; there's nothing but his own infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Purity, Truth, or Juſtice, can at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time divert his Mercies; but yet I think it's evident that we ſhall be jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for our Actions, as they are in their own Nature, and that too on the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of a rectified Conſcience, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb facs="tcp:135106:157"/>an erroneous Conſcience can be charged with Guilt. No one can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the Guilt of an Erroneous Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, where the Error is propagated thro' willfull Enormities, or manifeſt Neglects. Thus far the ſacred Canon is expreſs and clear, when we are told in the caſe of Error, that the Mind and Conſcience is defiled, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. And certainly where-ever there is Defilement, there muſt be Guilt, and where-ever there is Guilt there is at leaſt Puniſhment due. And I preſume it's ſufficiently demonſtrated that loſt Ideas will be revived, that every Action will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in its proper Dreſs, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the whole Oeconomy of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will be changed. If what has already been offered be not concluſive, the State of the Wicked after Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation will infer it. Now certainly whoever allows the divine Oeconomy of Conſcience muſt allow a future Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and if there's a future Judgment, and Men to be judged by their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, the moſt Hardened, Unrelent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sinner, will be brought to a clear ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the Line of Duty, and by this means forced to own the Juſtice of his Sentence; tho' his Conſcience
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:135106:158"/>was ſeered and paſt feeling, it ſhall now recover a double Force, and retain the quickeſt apprehenſion of Things; and Conſcience thus enforced, and armed with freſh Power and Vigour, ſhall be the eternal Inſtrument of increaſing the Torments of the damned. Since then Conſcience ſhall be thus regulated in Order to enhance, and perpetuate their Miſery, we may juſtly conclude that it's Regulation will commence at the great Tribunal, in Order to ratify the ſentence of Condemnation; and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſince it muſt be allowed that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will be an Inſtrument of future Condemnation, as well as Miſery; we muſt conclude that it will be one and the ſame Conſcience, acted by the ſame Meaſures and Principles, and of the ſame Extent and Latitude, and conſequently a Conſcience cleared from all Error and Miſtake, Partiality or Connivance; and in a Word, a Conſcience eſtabliſhed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Divine Oeconomy of it, the Law of God, and the eternal Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Moral Goodneſs and Duty. This is that <hi>Candle of the Lord,</hi> as the Wiſeman expreſſes it, that will diſplay its Light into the deepeſt receſſes of the Heart, and <hi>Search into the inward parts
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:135106:158"/>of the Belly,</hi> Prov. 20.27. In a Word it will be the inward Voice or Word of God, <hi>quick and powerful and Sharper than any two Edged Sword, piercing even to the dividing aſunder of Soul and Spirit, and of the Joynts and Marrow, and is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerner of the Thoughts, and intents of the Heart.</hi> Heb. 4.12.</p>
               <div n="2" type="section">
                  <p>§. 2. From what hath been ſaid it may not be improper to make ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Remarks upon Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s Notions of Conſcience. It's obſervable Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> makes Conſciouſneſs and Conſcience the ſame, and Conſcience to conſiſt in nothing elſe, but our own Opinions, of our own Actions; and purſuant to this, he affirms that in perſonal Identity which he makes to conſiſt in Conſciouſneſs, is founded all the Right and Juſtice of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, Rewards and Puniſhment. <hi>Book</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 27. <hi>§.</hi> 18.</p>
                  <p>But certainly the Conſcience that will prevail in the great day, will not be any Opinions we have entertained of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons when Committed tho' taken up at large: No, we ſhall then be acted by no other Opinions, but thoſe of a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated Conſcience, and they ſhall ſit as Judges, even over former Opinions, that were engendered by Neglect or Careleſſneſs, and nothing but invincible
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:135106:159"/>Ignorance, or ſincere Repentance, can deliver us from its Dominion. This is indiſputably evident from the Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Conſcience that ſhall be made according to the divine Oeconomy of it, whereby our Opinions of paſt Actions ſhall not be meaſured by former Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, but by the conformity of our Actions to the true Line of Duty, or means of Information. Again, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs which ſome Men might be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der when Enormities were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, cannot be the foundation of future Puniſhment, but that Conſciouſneſs of paſt Actions which will ariſe from a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated Conſcience. For it is conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that we may become conſcious of Enormities committed, of which we were not conſcious, when committed, and conſcious of others by wrong Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and Convictions; but it will be that Conſciouſneſs, and thoſe Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions we are under at the Great Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and reſult from a regulated Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that will be the meaſure of a final Abſolution or Condemnation. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> will not ſuffer his Notions to be guarded by theſe limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he muſt pardon me if I cannot comply with 'em, or cannot but eſteem 'em dangerous and falſe. On this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:135106:159"/>I cannot ſuffer an Inſtance, that ſeems to interfere with what is aſſerted, paſs off without a few Remarks. Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> in order to the eſtabliſhing his Notion of <hi>Perſonal Identity,</hi> brings in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normities committed in Dunkenneſs of which a Man is not conſcious, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces them upon a level with thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by a Man in his ſleep, making him no more anſwerable for the one than the other. He indeed makes the Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard in this caſe obnoxious to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Laws, for no other reaſon, but <hi>[Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in theſe caſes they cannot diſtinguiſh what is Real from what is Counterfeit, and ſo the Ignorance in Drunkenneſs or Sleep, is not admitted as a Plea.] But in the great Day wherein the Secrets of all Hearts ſhall be laid open, it may be reaſonable to think, no one ſhall be made to Anſwer for what he knows nothing of, but ſhall receive his Doom, his own Conſcience accuſing or excuſing him.</hi> See <hi>Sect.</hi> 22. <hi>Book</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 27. Here are a great many Paſſages that look with a very evil Aſpect, and therefore I ſhall ſay ſomething to each in their order. And firſt, I think this Author has drawn a very unjuſt Parallel between Crimes committed in Sleep and Dunkenneſs. It's well known that Sleep is a thing entailed on us as a Law, even
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:135106:160"/>a Law eſtabliſhed in the frame of our Beings, and commences upon the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of corruptible Nature, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if Miſchief accidently follows, it cannot well be imputed, becauſe it is founded in a Cauſe or Principle that is inſeparable from Humane Nature, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is an Appendage of the moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Powers of it, that ſet us on a level with Brutes, and conſequently the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that flow from it cannot be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But I hope this Author cannot plead a neceſſity of Nature for Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs. A quantity of generous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor may ſometimes be required for the actuating the Spirits, but never to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicate, unman, or drown the Reaſon. In a word, Drunkenneſs argues a willful neglect in humane Conduct, and as ſuch is an Act of a free Agent, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Actions that flow from it, tho' deſtitute of Choice or Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are juſtly imputed. For in order to the imputing or charging an Action up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, it is not neceſſary that it ſhould proceed from the free exerciſe of Reaſon, or previous Deliberation at the very Moment when Committed. It is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient that it's owing to a Cauſe that is to be eſteemed truly Deliberate and Wilful. If this were not ſo, it's impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:135106:160"/>any Sin of Ignorance can be Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable; a Poſition ſo wide from the line of Chriſtian Duty, that every Heathen Moraliſt will teach this Author the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity of it. I ſhall for once Refer him to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> becauſe he has culled out the caſe of Drunkenneſs to confirm the Doctrine. He aſſures us, Ignorance is Puniſhable whenever the cauſe of it can be charged upon us, and for this Reaſon, pronounces Crimes committed in Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, liable to double Puniſhment. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>Ethic. ad Nichom. Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Chap,</hi> 7.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed. As for the practice of Civil Governments in puniſhing Crimes committed when Diſguiſed by Drink, he has ſhamefully Miſrepreſented it, when he Suggeſts that the only Reaſon, is, becauſe they cannot diſtinguiſh what is Real from what is Counterfeit; and ſo the Ignorance in Drunkenneſs, or Sleep is not admitted as a Plea. It's a known truth, that Civil Judicatures take cognizance of nothing, but the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Act, and when this appears,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:135106:161"/>they conſtantly aſcribe the internal Principles of the Action, Knowledge and Freedom, where the Criminal is under no Natural Diſabilities, ſo that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that induce them to proceed to Cenſure in caſes of this Nature, can be no other, but thoſe which this excellent Moraliſt has aſſigned; for every ſuch Criminal has <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Tho' he was not Maſter of himſelf, when the Fact was committed, yet he is Acted by a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that made him Maſter of the cauſe of it; and conſequently the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may exerciſe a Right of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Again, every Government pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces the ignorance of Laws ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently Promulged, as well as ignorance of the Action in reſpect of the Relation it bears to the Law, an affected igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and conſequently, ſuch as not only renders the Action criminal, but ſuch as in the Eye of every Government is criminal in its own Nature; and this is the ſecond Reaſon aſſigned for double Puniſhment, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. In a word, it's viſible where there is, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, there the Action may be imputed, and conſequently Criminal; and for this Reaſon, Governments conſtantly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:135106:161"/>it ſo; but then when this is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as in the caſe of down-right Madneſs, where the Mind reſts under a Phyſical Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability, if Crimes or Miſchiefs, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted upon it, the Government only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires into the Symptoms of Madneſs, and upon Evidence, Acquits the reputed Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; and in theſe caſes I queſtion not, but the great Judge of all the World will do the like. But now, I think 'tis perfect De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, the true Reaſon why Humane Laws puniſh in the caſe before us, is not becauſe they cannot diſtinguiſh certainly what is Real, what Counterfeit. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As for the proceedings of the great Day, I preſume, they may Lawfully move upon thoſe Meaſures, and Principles, that Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Tribunals have recourſe to, as their undoubted prerogative, and tho Enormities committed thro Madneſs, or Sleep, may not be ſtrictly accounted for; yet I'm perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, no Ignorance founded in Drunkenneſs, will ever be admitted a plea of Innocence, as is apparently Suggeſted by this Author. It's abundantly concluded, that Conſcience will be Regulated according to the Divine Oeconomy of it; and that it will aſcribe to its ſelf, and yield an Aſſent to a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Actions, which the preſent State of ſome Mens Conſciences <hi>either know nothing of,</hi> or at leaſt have cauſed them to be pronounced Innocent. And certainly, where the Conſcience can be convinc'd that ſuch a particular Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity is to be reſolv'd into willfull neglects, as in the caſe of Drunkenneſs, it will aſcribe the
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:135106:162"/>Action, and charge a Guilt upon us, and by this means a Man may be haraſſed with an Accuſing Conſcience at the Great Day, when the Secrets of all Hearts ſhall be laid oper, for things he at preſent knows little of.</p>
